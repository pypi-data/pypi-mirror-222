# Rateslib

**This version is beta pre-release. It may change at any point without notice.**

``Rateslib`` is a state-of-the-art **fixed income library** designed for Python.
Its purpose is to provide advanced, flexible and efficient fixed income analysis
with a high level, well documented API.

Its design objective is to be able to create a self-consistent, arbitrage free
framework for pricing all aspects of fixed income trading, such as spot FX, FX forwards,
single currency securities and derivatives like fixed rate bonds and IRSs, and also
multi-currency derivatives such as FX swaps and cross-currency swaps. Options,
swaptions and inflation are also under consideration for future development.

The techniques and object interation within *rateslib* were inspired by
the requirements of multi-disciplined fixed income teams working, both cooperatively
and independently, within global investment banks.
