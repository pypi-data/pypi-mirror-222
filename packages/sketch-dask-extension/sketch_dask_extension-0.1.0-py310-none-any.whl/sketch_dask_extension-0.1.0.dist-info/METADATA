# Sketch Dask Extension

This is a very simple extension to extend the support of [Sketch](https://github.com/approximatelabs/sketch) to Dask Dataframes instead of only Pandas.
This is **experimental** and not meant to be used in critical environments.

## How to install

```bash
python -m pip install sketch-dask-extension
```

## How to use

```python
from dask.dataframe import read_csv
import sketch-dask-extension

dataframe = read_csv('...')

dataframe.sketch.ask('tell me something interesting')
```
