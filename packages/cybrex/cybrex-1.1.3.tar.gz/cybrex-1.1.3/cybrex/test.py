 - 10.1038/nrendo.2016.104: In a wide range of species, including humans, calorie restriction is effectively the sole intervention with proven effects of promoting increased lifespan.Although the underlying mechanisms for these calorie-restriction-mediated effects are not completely understood, many of the suggested processes involve mitochondria . Investigations in humans, however, are limited. Weight loss has been recognized to improve insulin sensitivity, but studies examining the effects of weight loss often practice a rigid restriction in energy intake that is not comparable to the calorie restriction regimes performed in other species. One of the best controlled and longest calorie restriction trials in humans, featuring a 25% reduction of baseline energy requirements, reported reduced fasting insulin levels and increased gene expression of PGC-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and SIRT1, along with increased mtDNA content in skeletal muscle after calorie restriction , which indicates that mitochondrial remodelling might
 - 10.1056/nejmra1905136: reduction in fat.The discrepant results of two landmark studies in monkeys challenged the link between health-span extension and life-span extension with caloric restriction. One of the studies, at the University of Wisconsin, showed a positive effect of caloric restriction on both health and survival, whereas the other study, at the National Institute on Aging, showed no significant reduction in mortality, despite clear improvements in overall health. Differences in the daily caloric intake, onset of the intervention, diet composition, feeding protocols, sex, and genetic background may explain the differential effects of caloric restriction on life span in the two studies. In humans, intermittent-fasting interventions ameliorate obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation. Intermittent fasting seems to confer health benefits to a greater extent than can be attributed just to a reduction in caloric intake. In one trial, 16 healthy participants assigned to a regimen of
 - 10.1016/c2020-0-03921-6: The beneficial effects of caloric restriction (CR) on lifespan have been discovered more than a century ago . Later, the positive effect of CR on healthspan and lifespan has been documented in many model organisms, such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and primates, pointing to the strong evolutionary conservation of the common mechanisms connecting food intake to longevity . CR involves a 20%À40% reduction in calorie intake without causing malnutrition. Also, in humans, data from observational and randomized clinical trials indicate that CR elicits the same mechanisms and beneficial effects as in animal models of longevity. Moderate CR in humans ameliorates multiple metabolic and hormonal factors that are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders, the leading causes of morbidity, disability, and mortality .Food provides us with nutrients and energy necessary for growth, reproduction, and the sustainence of
 - 10.1038/s41392-022-01052-5: In a recent study published in science, Spadaro and colleagues described the downregulation of PLA2G7 through sustained calory restriction as a crucial factor for lowering inflammatory mechanisms and contributing to longevity. PLA2G7's identification as a critical regulatory gene is important to better understand the role of adipose tissue metabolism in regulating immune-metabolic effects. These data show that long-term calorie restriction (CR) improves health and extends life expectancy. Chronic 40% CR increases susceptibility to infections in mice, shortening their lifespan. In contrast, the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) analysis found that moderate CR in humans over 24 months did not reduce immune functions. 14% sustained CR was associated with improved adipose tissue metabolism, decreased inflammation, and reduced thymic lipoatrophy. Spadaro et al. discovered that low platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PLA2G7) correlates with

DOI: 10.1038/s41576-022-00477-6 interventions, particularly in humans, should explore which is necessary to reap benefits.Several animal studies in rodents and monkeys have investigated the effect of calorie restriction on the DNAm signatures of ageing, reporting that calorie restriction shifts the methylome to a younger profile by attenuating the age-related DNAm alterations in several tissues, such as the blood , liver , kidney and hippocampus . For instance, a study in liver tissue of female mice reported that calorie restriction increased methylation at DMPs that usually become hypomethylated with age and decreased methylation at DMPs that usually become hypermethylated with age . Another study in rhesus monkeys and mice reported that calorie restriction counteracts epigenetic drift in the blood, shifting the methylation patterns of calorie-restricted older mice and monkeys to resemble their younger counterparts . Moreover, calorie restriction decelerates epigenetic ageing by directly affecting the DNAm changes that underpin the
DOI: 10.1038/s41576-022-00477-5 Moreover, calorie restriction decelerates epigenetic ageing by directly affecting the DNAm changes that underpin the epigenetic clock . Co-methylation networks exploring the effects of calorie restriction on conserved ageing modules in multiple species and tissues have also reported that calorie restriction leads to DNAm changes in the opposite direction to age (for example, CpGs within a module that become hypermethylated with age exhibit a decrease in DNAm following calorie restriction) .Although the evidence outlined above is limited, it suggests that calorie restriction promotes longevity, at least in part, by slowing the epigenetic changes associated with primary ageing. However, data on calorie restriction and longevity in humans are needed to confirm this hypothesis. More research is required to determine whether the influence of calorie restriction on DNAm is the causative factor underpinning the healthspan and lifespan-extending properties of dietary restriction. To our knowledge, no studies have
DOI: 10.1038/s41576-022-00477-4 If accumulated alterations to the methylome have a causal role in age-related decline, then such changes should, in theory, be alleviated or reversed by longevity-promoting interventions. This concept underlies certain dietary, drug and epigenetic rejuvenation strategies.Dietary restriction. Dietary restriction entails limiting the quantity or timing of food intake. Calorie restriction is the long-term reduction of calories below standard requirements without incurring malnutrition, and is a well-known longevity-enhancing strategy . In humans, calorie restriction reduces the risk of age-associated diseases, including T2D, cancer and CVD, and extends both healthspan and lifespan in mammals . Intermittent fasting, or time-restricted feeding, also seems to promote healthy ageing . Because calorie restriction and fasting are often combined during dietary restriction strategies , future interventions, particularly in humans, should explore which is necessary to reap benefits.Several animal studies in rodents and

Similarly, 'longevity drugs' mimic the longevity effects of dietary restriction by targeting the same metabolic pathways . Animal studies have demonstrated that calorie restriction can restore the tissue-specific circadian rhythmicity of key metabolic genes, suggesting that longevity benefits involve the restoration of healthy circadian cycles . Polyamines also show circadian rhythmicity and, in turn, regulate the circadian period. In mice, supplementation with spermidine counteracts the age-associated decline in circadian cycles by regulating the interaction between the core clock factors .A vital link between ageing, metabolism and circadian rhythms is NAD + , the central catalyst of
