# CodeBox

CodeBox is the simplest cloud infrastructure for your LLM Apps and Services.
It allows you to run python code in an isolated/sandboxed environment.
Additionally, it provides simple fileIO (and vector database support coming soon).

## Installation

You can install CodeBox with pip:

```bash
pip install codeboxapi
```

## Usage

```python
from codeboxapi import CodeBox, set_api_key


set_api_key("sk-************************")
# or put your api key inside the .env file
# CODEBOX_API_KEY=your-api-key

# create and startup
codebox = CodeBox()
codebox.start()

# check if it's running
print(str(codebox.status()) == "running")

# run some code
result = codebox.run("print('Hello, World!')")

# print the result
print(result)

codebox.stop()
```

## Where to get your api-key?

CodeBox is currently in early development so I created a stripe payment link as login system:
https://pay.codeboxapi.com/b/00g3e6dZX2fTg0gaEE
As BetaTester you get 70% with the code `BETA`. 
Bear in mind, we don't have many automations set up right now, 
so you'll need to write an [email](mailto:contact@codeboxapi.com) for things like refunds, 
sub cancellations, or upgrades.
