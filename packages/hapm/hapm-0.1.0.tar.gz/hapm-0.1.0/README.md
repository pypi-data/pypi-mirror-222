# Home Assistant Package Manager

Package manager for Home Assistant which allows you to prepare components for a Stateless Docker image.

## Installation

```sh
pip install hapm
```

## Configuration

A manifest (`hapm.yaml`) is a list of links, divided into several categories. The links are written in a special format and necessarily have a version with `@` in it.

For example: `github.com/user/integration@v1.0.0`.

The version specifies an existing tag or branch in the specified repository.

A link may not have an https prefix, in which case it will be inserted automatically during the reading phase.

```yaml

  - github.com/mishamyrt/dohome_rgb@v0.3.0
