Assamer: ASAP2 (A2L) and ASSAM Library
======================================

Assamer is a Python library for reading ASAP2 (A2L) files, parsing HEX
files, and performing analysis using the ASAP2 Signal and Software
Analysis and Monitoring (ASSAM) framework.

Installation
------------

You can install Assamer using the pip package manager. Run the following
command to install Assamer:

::

   pip install assamer

Usage
-----

Assamer library provides classes and functions for reading ASAP2 files,
parsing HEX files, and performing ASSAM analysis.

Reading ASAP2 Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To read an ASAP2 file, you can use the ``A2L`` class. For example:

.. code:: python

   from ASSAM import A2L

   a2l = A2L("path/to/a2l_file.a2l")
   data = a2l.data
   compu_methods = a2l.getArea(COMPU_METHOD)
   characteristics = a2l.getArea(CHARACTERISTIC)
   # Other operations

Parsing HEX Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To parse a HEX file, you can use the ``A2LHex`` class. For example:

.. code:: python

   from ASSAM import A2LHex

   hexa2l = A2LHex("path/to/hex_file.hex")
   hex_data = hexa2l.data
   value = hexa2l.readValue(0x8040CD34, FLOAT32_IEEE, 5)
   # Other operations

ASSAM Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform ASSAM analysis, you can use the ``ASSAM`` class. For example:

.. code:: python

   from ASSAM import ASSAM, TrackA2L

   a2l = A2L("path/to/a2l_file.a2l")
   hexa2l = A2LHex("path/to/hex_file.hex")
   assam = ASSAM(A2L_Object=a2l, HEX_Object=hexa2l)
   # Other operations

In the above examples, only some basic functions and classes are used.
The Assamer library provides more functionality for ASAP2 file handling
and ASSAM analysis. For detailed usage examples and functions, please
refer to the documentation.
