class EvQueue:
    """
    A simple event queue with support for topics.

    This class provides functionality to manage events published to different topics
    and deliver them to their respective event handlers based on their delivery time.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _events : list[tuple[int, str, tuple, dict], ...]
        The list of events in the queue, ordered by their delivery time.
    _topics : dict[str, list[Callable, ...]]
        A dictionary containing topics as keys and lists of event handler functions as values.

    Methods
    -------
    subscribe(topic: str, handler: Callable):
        Subscribe a handler function to a topic.

    unsubscribe(topic: str, handler: Callable):
        Unsubscribe a handler function from a topic.

    publish(topic: str, delivery_time: int, *args, **kwargs):
        Publish an event to a topic with a specific delivery time.

    publish_relative(topic: str, delay: int, *args, **kwargs):
        Publish an event to a topic with a relative delay from the current time.

    run_until(target_time: int):
        Process events in the queue until the target time is reached.

    empty() -> bool:
        Check if there are any undelivered events in the queue.

    Notes
    -----
    - The event queue is implemented as a priority queue to efficiently handle event scheduling.
    - Events are ordered by their delivery time, and events with the same delivery time are delivered in the order they were published.
    - Event handlers should be callable objects that accept variable arguments and keyword arguments.

    Examples
    --------
    # Create an instance of the event queue
    event_queue = EventQueue()

    # Subscribe to a topic
    def event_handler(arg):
        print(f"Event received with argument: {arg}")
    event_queue.subscribe('topic1', event_handler)

    # Publish an event to be delivered at time 10
    event_queue.publish('topic1', 10, "Hello, World!")

    # Run events until time 15
    event_queue.run_until(15)

    # Check if there are undelivered events in the queue
    if event_queue.empty():
        print("No undelivered events in the queue.")
