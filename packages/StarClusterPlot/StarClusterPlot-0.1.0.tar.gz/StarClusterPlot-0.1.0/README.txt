This is a Python library for visualizing star clusters and their Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams. 
All stars colors shown in this program are derived from their calculated temperatures.
The package includes two functions: ClusterVis() and HRDiagram(). 
The former takes one dataframe as a required input along withÂ two optional parameters to set the x and y scale of the plot. The latter simply requires one dataframe input.
