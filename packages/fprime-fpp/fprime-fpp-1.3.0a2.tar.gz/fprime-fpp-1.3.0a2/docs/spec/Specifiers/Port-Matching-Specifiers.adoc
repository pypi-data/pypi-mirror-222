=== Port Matching Specifiers

A *port matching specifier* is part of a
<<Definitions_Component-Definitions,component definition>>.
It specifies that when the component is instantiated and
connected into a topology, the corresponding port numbers
of two of its port instances should match.
For example, a port matching specifier could specify that
for a health monitoring component, any component connected
to its ping output port at port number _n_ should also be connected
to its ping input port at the same port number _n_.

==== Syntax

`match` 
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`with`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>

==== Semantics

. Each of the identifiers must name a
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,general port instance>>
specified in the enclosing component.

. The two port instances must be distinct and must have the same
array size.

==== Example

[source,fpp]
----
queued component Health {

  @ Number of ping ports
  constant numPingPorts = 10

  @ Ping output port
  output port pingOut: [numPingPorts] Svc.Ping

  @ Ping input port
  async input port pingIn: [numPingPorts] Svc.Ping

  @ Corresponding port numbers of pingOut and pingIn must match
  match pingOut with pingIn

}
