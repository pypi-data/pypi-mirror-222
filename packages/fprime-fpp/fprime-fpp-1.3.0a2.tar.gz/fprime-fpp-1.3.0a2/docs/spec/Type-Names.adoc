== Type Names

*Type names* are the syntactic names of
<<Types,types>>.
In some cases, e.g., `U32`, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between type names and types.
In other cases, e.g., array types, there is no one-to-one correspondence.
For example, depending on the enclosing scope, the name
`a.b` and the name `b` may refer to the same array type.

=== Primitive Integer Type Names

*Primitive integer type names* are the names of the
<<Types_Primitive-Integer-Types,primitive integer types>>.
There are two kinds of primitive
integer types: unsigned integer types and signed integer types.

* The names of the unsigned integer types are `U8`, `U16`, `U32`, and `U64`.
The `U` stands for "`unsigned.`" The number after the U is the width of the
representation in bits, using the standard binary representation of an
unsigned integer.

* The names of the signed integer types are `I8`, `I16`, `I32`, and `I64`. The
`I` stands for "`[signed] integer.`" The number after the I is the width of
the representation in bits, using the standard binary two's complement
representation of a signed integer.

=== Floating-Point Type Names

The *floating-point type names* are `F32` and `F64`. These refer to the types
of IEEE
floating-point values of width 32 and 64 bits, respectively.

=== The Boolean Type Name

The type name `bool` represents the type of the two Boolean values `true` and
`false`.

=== String Type Names

A *string type name* consists of the keyword `string` optionally
followed by the keyword `size` and an
<<Expressions,_expression_>>. For example:
[source,fpp]
----
string
string size 256
----

The optional expression following the keyword `size` is called the *size
expression* of the string type name.  If present, it must have a
<<Types_Internal-Types_Numeric-Types,numeric type>>, and it must
evaluate to a value in the range [0,2^31^) after conversion to
<<Types_Internal-Types_Integer,_Integer_>>.
The size expression specifies the maximum
length of a string value represented by the type.  If the size expression is
not present, then the translator uses a default maximum string length.

=== Qualified Identifier Type Names

A *qualified identifier type name* is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified
identifier>> that refers to an
<<Definitions_Abstract-Type-Definitions,abstract type definition>>,
<<Definitions_Array-Definitions,array definition>>,
<<Definitions_Enum-Definitions,enum definition>>, or
<<Definitions_Struct-Definitions,struct definition>>
 via the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,rules
for name scoping>>.
It names the
<<Types,type>> defined in the definition to which it refers.

For example:


[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  type T
  array A = [3] T # T is a qualified identifier t type name. It names the type M.T.
}
----

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  array A = [3] U8
  array B = [3] A # A is an array type name. It names the type M.A.
}
----

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  enum E { X = 0, Y = 1 }
  array A = [3] E # E is a qualified identifier type name. It names the type M.E.
}
----

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  struct S {
    x: U32
    y: F32
  }
  struct T {
    s: S # S is a qualified identifier type name. It names the type M.S.
  }
}
----
