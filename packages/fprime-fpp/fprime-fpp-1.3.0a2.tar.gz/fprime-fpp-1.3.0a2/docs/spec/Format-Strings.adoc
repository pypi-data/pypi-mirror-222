== Format Strings

A *format string* is a string that specifies the display format
of a
<<Definitions_Struct-Definitions,struct member>>,
<<Definitions_Array-Definitions,array element>>,
<<Specifiers_Event-Specifiers,event report>>, or
<<Specifiers_Telemetry-Channel-Specifiers,telemetry channel>>.

An FPP format string is similar to a
https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/string.html#formatstrings[Python format 
string].
As in python, a format string consists of text containing one or more
*replacement fields* surrounded by curly braces `{` `}`.
In the output, each replacement field is replaced by the value of an 
*argument*.
Characters outside of replacement fields are copied to the output unchanged,
except that the escape sequences `{{` and `}}` are converted to single 
braces.

The number of arguments must match the number of replacement fields.
Each replacement field must also match the type of its argument, as
discussed below.

The following replacement fields are allowed:

. You can use the *default replacement field* `{}` to convert any argument.
It causes the argument to be displayed in a standard way
for F Prime according to its type.

. If the type of an argument _a_ is an 
<<Types_Internal-Types_Integer-Types,integer type>>,
then you can use an *integer replacement field* to convert _a_.
An integer replacement field is one of the following:

.. `{c}`: Display _a_ as a character value.

.. `{d}`: Display _a_ as a decimal integer value

.. `{x}`: Display _a_ as a hexadecimal integer value.

.. `{o}`: Display _a_ as an octal integer value.

. If the type of an argument _a_ is a 
<<Types_Floating-Point-Types,floating-point type>>,
then you can use a *rational replacement field* to convert _a_.
A rational replacement field is one of the following:

.. `{e}`: Display _a_ as a rational number using exponent notation, e.g., `1.234e2`

.. `{f}`: Display _a_ as a rational number using fixed-point notation, e.g., `123.4`.

.. `{g}`: Display _a_ as a rational number using general format. This format 
uses fixed-point notation for
numbers up to some size _s_ and uses exponent notation for numbers larger than 
_s_.
The value of _s_ is implementation-dependent.

.. One of the replacement fields denoted above, but with a period and a literal
decimal integer after the opening brace.
The integer value _n_ specifies the *precision*, i.e., the number of digits after
the decimal point for fixed-point notation, or before the `e` for exponent 
notation.
For example, the replacement field `{.3f}`, specifies fixed-point notation
with a precision of 3.
_n_ must be in the range [0,100].

No other replacement fields are allowed.
No other use of `{` or `}` is allowed, except in the escape sequences
`{{` and `}}`.
