== Introduction

This document describes **F Prime Prime**, also known as FPP or F Double Prime.
FPP is a modeling language for the
https://nasa.github.io/fprime/[F Prime flight software framework].
A https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2018/all2018/328/[paper presented at
SmallSat 2018]
provides an overview of F Prime.
For more detailed information about F Prime, see the
https://github.com/nasa/fprime/blob/master/docs/UsersGuide/guide.md[F Prime User's Guide].

The goals of FPP are as follows:

* To provide a modeling language for F Prime that is simple, easy to use, and
well-tailored to its purpose.

* To provide semantic checking and error reporting for F Prime models.

* To generate code in the various languages that F Prime uses, e.g.,
{cpp}, Python, XML.
In this document, we will call these languages the *target languages*.

Developers may combine code generated from FPP with code written by hand to
create, e.g., deployable FSW programs and ground data environments.

The name "F Double Prime" (or F'') deliberately suggests the idea of a
"derivative"
of F Prime (or F').
By "integrating" an FPP model (i.e., running the tools) you get a partial
FSW implementation in the F Prime framework; and then by "integrating" again
(i.e., providing
the project-specific {cpp} implementation) you get a FSW application.

*Purpose:* The purpose of this document is to describe FPP in a way that is accessible
to users, including beginning users.
A more detailed and precise description is available in
https://fprime-community.github.io/fpp/fpp-spec.html[_The FPP Language
Specification_].
We recommend that you read this document before consulting that one.

*XML limitations:*
Currently we translate FPP to F Prime XML and then to {cpp}.
Some features of FPP are not supported in the XML representation.
Where a feature is not supported in XML, we will call out this fact in a
note marked *XML limitation*.
As we continue to develop FPP, we will phase in support
for all the features described here.

*GDS limitations:*
It is currently possible to construct FPP models that are not
fully supported by the F Prime Ground Data System (GDS).
Where an FPP feature is not supported in the GDS, we will call out this
fact in a note marked *GDS limitation.*

*Overview:* The rest of this document proceeds as follows.
Section 2 explains how to get up and running with FPP.
Sections 3 through 11 describe the elements of an FPP
model, starting with the simplest elements (constants
and types) and working towards the most complex (components
and topologies).
Section 12 explains how to specify a model as a collection
of files: for example, it covers the management of dependencies
between files.
Section 13 explains how to analyze FPP models and how
to translate FPP models to XML, to {cpp}, and from XML.
Section 14 explains how to write a {cpp} implementation
against the code generated from an FPP model.
