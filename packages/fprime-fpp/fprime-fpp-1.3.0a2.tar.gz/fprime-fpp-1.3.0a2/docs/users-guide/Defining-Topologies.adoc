== Defining Topologies

In F Prime, a *topology* or connection graph is the
highest level of software architecture in a FSW application.
A topology specifies what
<<Defining-Component-Instances,component instances>>
are used in the application and how their
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances,port instances>>
are connected.

An F Prime FSW application consists of a topology _T_;
all the types, ports, and components used by _T_;
and a small amount of top-level {cpp} code that you write by hand.
In the section on
<<Writing-C-Plus-Plus-Implementations_Implementing-Deployments,
implementing deployments>>, we will explain more about the top-level
{cpp} code.
In this section we explain how to define a topology in FPP.

=== A Simple Example

We begin with a simple example that shows how many of the pieces
fit together.

[source,fpp]
----
port P

passive component C {
  sync input port pIn: P
  output port pOut: P
}

instance c1: C base id 0x100
instance c2: C base id 0x200

@ A simple topology
topology Simple {

  @ This specifier says that instance c1 is part of the topology
  instance c1
  @ This specifier says that instance c2 is part of the topology
  instance c2

  @ This code specifies a connection graph C1
  connections C1 {
    c1.pOut -> c2.pIn
  }

  @ This code specifies a connection graph C2
  connections C2 {
    c2.pOut -> c1.pIn
  }

}
----

In this example, we define a <<Defining-Ports,port>> `P`.
Then we define a <<Defining-Components,passive component>> `C`
with an input port and an output port, both of type `P`.
We define two  <<Defining-Component-Instances,instances>> of
`C`, `c1` and `c2`.
We put these instances into a topology called `Simple`.

As shown, to define a topology, you write the keyword `topology`,
the name of the topology, and the members of the topology
definition enclosed in curly braces.
In this case, the topology has two kinds of members:

. Two *instance specifiers* specifying that instances
`c1` and `c2` are part of the topology.

. Two *graph specifiers* that specify connection graphs
named `C1` and `C2`.

As shown, to write an instance specifier, you write the
keyword `instance` and the name of a component instance
definition.
In general the name may be a qualified name such as `A.B`
if the instance is defined inside a
<<Defining-Modules,module>>; in this simple
example it is not.
Each instance specifier states that the instance it names
is part of the topology.
The instances appearing in the list must be distinct.
For example, this is not correct:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology T {
  instance c1
  instance c1 # Error: duplicate instance c1
}
--------

A graph specifier specifies one or more connections
between component instances.
Each graph specifier has a name.
By dividing the connections of a topology into named
graphs, you can organize the connections in a meaningful way.
For example you can have one graph group
for connections that send commands, another one
for connections that send telemetry, and so forth.
We will have more to say about this in a later section.

As shown, to write a graph specifier, you may write the keyword `connections`
followed by the name of the graph; then you may list
the connections inside curly braces.
(In the next section, we will explain another way to write a graph specifier.)
Each connection consists of an endpoint, an arrow `pass:[->]`,
and another endpoint.
An endpoint is the name of a component instance
(which in general may be a qualified name), a dot,
and the name of a port of that component instance.

In this example there are two connection graphs, each containing
one connection:

. A connection graph `C1` containing a connection from `c1.pOut` to `c2.pIn`.

. A connection graph `C2` containing a connection from `c2.pOut` to `c1.pIn`.

As shown, topologies and their members are
<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,annotatable elements>>.
The topology members form an
<<Defining-Constants_Multiple-Definitions-and-Element-Sequences,
element sequence>> in which the optional
terminating punctuation is a semicolon.

=== Connection Graphs

In general, an FPP topology consists of a list of instances
and a set of named connection graphs.
There are two ways to specify connection graphs:
*direct graph specifiers* and *pattern graph specifiers*.

==== Direct Graph Specifiers

A direct graph specifier provides a name and a list
of connections.
We illustrated direct graph specifiers in the
previous section, where the simple topology example
included direct graph specifiers for graphs named
`C1` and `C2`.
Here are some more details about direct graph specifiers.

As shown in the previous section, each connection consists
of an output port specifier, followed by an arrow, followed
by an input port specifier.
For example:

[source,fpp]
--------
connections C {
  a.p -> b.p
}
--------

Each of the two port specifiers consists of a component
instance name, followed by a dot, followed the name of a port instance.
The component instance name must refer to a
<<Defining-Component-Instances,component instance definition>>
and may be qualified by a module name.
For example:

[source,fpp]
--------
connections C {
  M.a.p -> N.b.p
}
--------

Here component instance `a` is defined in module `M` and component
instance `b` is defined in module `N`.
In a port specifier `a.p`, the port instance name `p` must refer to a
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances,port instance>> of the
component definition associated with the component instance `a`.

Each component instance named in a connection must be part of the
instance list in the topology.
For example, if you write a connection `a.b pass:[->] c.d` inside
a topology `T`, and the specifier `instance a` does not
appear inside topology `T`, then you will get an error --
even if `a` is a valid instance name for the FPP model.
The reason for this rule is that in flight code we need
to be very careful about which instances are included
in the application.
Naming all the instances also lets us check for
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Checking-Models,
unconnected ports>>.

You may use the same name in more than one direct
graph specifier in the same topology.
If you do this, then all specifiers with the same
name are combined into a single graph with that name.
For example, this code

[source,fpp]
--------
connections C {
  a.p -> b.p
}
connections C {
  c.p -> d.p
}
--------

is equivalent to this code:

[source,fpp]
--------
connections C {
  a.p -> b.p
  c.p -> d.p
}
--------

The members of a direct graph specifier form an
<<Defining-Constants_Multiple-Definitions-and-Element-Sequences,
element sequence>> in which the optional
terminating punctuation is a comma.
For example, you can write this:

[source,fpp]
--------
connections C { a.p -> b.p, c.p -> d.p }
--------

The connections appearing in direct graph specifiers must obey the
following rules:

* Each connection must go from an output port instance to
an input port instance.

* The types of the ports must match, except that a
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Serial-Port-Instances,
serial port instance>> may be connected to a port of any
type.
In particular, serial to serial connections are allowed.

* If a typed port _P_ is connected to a serial port in either direction,
then the port type of _P_ may not specify a
<<Defining-Ports_Returning-Values,return type>>.

==== Pattern Graph Specifiers

A few connection patterns are so common in F Prime that they
get special treatment in FPP.
For example, an F Prime topology typically includes an
instance of the component `Svc.Time`.
This component has a port `timeGetPort`
of type `Fw.Time` that other components can use to get the system
time.
Any component that gets the system time
(and there are usually several) has a connection to
the `timeGetPort` port of the `Svc.Time` instance.

Suppose you are constructing a topology in which
(1) `sysTime` is an instance of `Svc.Time`; and (2)
each of the instances
`a`, `b`, `c`, etc., has a
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Time-Get-Ports, time get port>>
`timeGetOut` port connected to `sysTime.timeGetPort`,
If you used a direct graph specifier to write all these connections,
the result might look like this:

[source,fpp]
--------
connections Time {
  a.timeGetOut -> sysTime.timeGetPort
  b.timeGetOut -> sysTime.timeGetPort
  c.timeGetOut -> sysTime.timeGetPort
  ...
}
--------

This works, but it is tedious and repetitive. So FPP provides
a better way: you can use a *pattern graph specifier*
to specify this common pattern.
You can write

[source,fpp]
--------
time connections instance sysTime
--------

This code says the following:

. Use the instance `sysTime` as the instance of `Fw.Time`
for the time connection pattern.

. Automatically construct a direct graph specifier named `Time`.
In this direct graph specifier, include one connection
from each component instance that has a time get port
to the input port of `sysTime` of type `Fw.Time`.

The result is as if you had written the direct graph specifier
yourself.
All the other rules for direct graph specifiers apply: for example,
if you write another direct graph specifier with name `Time`, then
the connections in that specifier are merged with the connections
generated by the pattern specifier.

In the example above, we call `time` the *kind* of the pattern
graph specifier.
We call `sysTime` the *source instance* of the pattern.
It is the source of all the time pattern connections
in the topology.
We call the instances that have time get ports (and so contribute
connections to the pattern) the *target instances*.
They are the instances targeted by the pattern once the source
instance is named.

Table <<pattern-graph-specifiers>> shows the pattern graph
specifiers allowed in FPP.
The columns of the table have the following meanings:

* *Kind:* The keyword or keywords denoting the kind.
When writing the specifier, these appear just before
the keyword `connections`, as shown above for the time example.

* *Source Instance:* The source instance for the pattern.

* *Target Instances:* The target instances for the pattern.

* *Graph Name:* The name of the connection graph
generated by the pattern.

* *Connections:* The connections generated by the pattern.

The command pattern specifier generates three connection graphs:
`Command`, `CommandRegistration`, and `CommandResponse`.

|===

Here are some rules for writing graph pattern specifiers:

. At most one occurrence of each pattern kind is allowed in
each topology.

. For each pattern, the required ports shown in the table
must exist and must be unambiguous.
For example, if you write a time pattern
+
[source,fpp]
--------
time connections instance sysTime
--------
+
then you will get an error if `sysTime` has no
input ports of type `Fw.Time`,
You will also get an error if `sysTime` has two or more
such ports.

The default behavior for a pattern is
to generate the connections for all target instances
as shown in the table.
If you wish, you may generate connections for a selected
set of target instances.
To do this, you write a list of target instances enclosed in
curly braces after the source instance.
For example, suppose a topology contains instances
`a`, `b`, and `c` each of which has an output port
that satisfies the time pattern.
And suppose that `sysTime` is an instance of `Svc.Time`.
Then if you write this pattern

[source,fpp]
--------
time connections instance sysTime
--------

you will get a connection graph `Time` containing
time connections from each of `a`, `b`, and `c` to `sysTime`.
But if you write this pattern

[source,fpp]
--------
time connections instance sysTime {
  a
  b
}
--------

then you will just get the connections from `a` and `b`
to `sysTime`.
The instances `a` and `b` must be valid target instances
for the pattern.

As with connections, you can write the instances `a` and `b`
each on its own line, or you can separate them with commas:

[source,fpp]
--------
time connections instance sysTime { a, b }
--------

=== Port Numbering

As discussed in the
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Arrays-of-Port-Instances,
section on defining components>>,
each named port instance is actually an array of
one or more port instances.
When the size of the array exceeds one, you
must specify the port number (i.e., the array index)
of each connection going into or out of the port instance.
In FPP, there are three ways to specify port numbers:
explicit numbering, matched numbering, and general numbering.

==== Explicit Numbering

To use explicit numbering, you provide an explicit port number
for a connection endpoint.
You write the port number as a 
<<Defining-Constants_Expressions,numeric expression>>
in square brackets, immediately following the port name.
The port numbers start at zero.

For example, the `RateGroups` graph of the Ref (reference) topology in the F Prime 
repository defines the rate group connections.
It contains the following connection:

[source,fpp]
--------
rateGroupDriverComp.CycleOut[Ports.RateGroups.rateGroup1] -> rateGroup1Comp.CycleIn
rateGroup1Comp.RateGroupMemberOut[0] -> SG1.schedIn
rateGroup1Comp.RateGroupMemberOut[1] -> SG2.schedIn
rateGroup1Comp.RateGroupMemberOut[2] -> chanTlm.Run
rateGroup1Comp.RateGroupMemberOut[3] -> fileDownlink.Run
--------

The first line says to connect the port at index
`Ports.RateGroups.rateGroup1` of `rateGroupDriverComp.CycleOut`
to `rateGroup1Comp.CycleIn`.
The symbol `Ports.RateGroups.rateGroup1` is an enumerated constant, defined
like this:

[source,fpp]
----
module Ports {

  enum RateGroups {
    rateGroup1
    rateGroup2
    rateGroup3
  }

}
----

The second and following lines say to connect the ports of
`rateGroup1Comp.RateGroupMemberOut` at the indices 0, 1, 2, and 3
in the manner shown.

As another example, the `Downlink` graph of the reference topology 
contains the following connection:

[source,fpp]
--------
downlink.framedAllocate -> staticMemory.bufferAllocate[Ports.StaticMemory.downlink]
--------

This line says to connect `downlink.framedAllocate` to
`staticMemory.bufferAllocate` at index
`Port.StaticMemory.downlink`.
Again the port index is a symbolic constant.

If you wish, you may write two explicit port numbers,
one at each endpoint.
For example:

[source,fpp]
--------
a.b[0] -> c.d[1]
--------

Here are some rules to keep in mind when using explicit numbering:

. You can write any numeric expression as a port number.
Each port number must be in bounds for the port (greater than
or equal to zero and less than the size of the port array).
If you write a port number that is out of bounds, you will get an error.

. Use symbolic constants judiciously.
Avoid scattering "magic" literal
constants throughout the topology definition.
For example:

.. The Ref topology uses the symbolic constants
`Ports.RateGroups.rateGroup1` and `Ports.StaticMemory.downlink`, as shown
above.
Because these constants appear in several different places, it is 
better to use symbolic constants here.
Using literal constants would decrease readability and increase
the chance of using incorrect or inconsistent numbers.

.. The Ref topology uses the literal constants 0, 1, 2, and 3
to connect the ports of `rateGroup1Comp.RateGroupMemberOut`.
Here there are no obvious names to associate with the numbers, 
the numbers go in sequence, and all the numbers appear together in one place.
So there is no clear benefit to giving them names.

. Remember that in F Prime, multiple connections can go to the same
input port, but only one connection can go from each output port.
For example, this code is allowed:
+
[source,fpp]
--------
c1.p1 -> c2.p[0]
c1.p2 -> c2.p[0] # OK: Two connections into c2.p[0]
--------
+
But this code is incorrect:
+
[source,fpp]
--------
c1.p[0] -> c2.p1
c1.p[0] -> c2.p2 # Error: Two connections out of c1.p[0]
--------

. Use explicit numbering as little as possible.
Instead, use matched numbering or general numbering
(described in the next sections) and let FPP
do the numbering for you.
In particular, avoid writing zero indices such as
`c.p[0]` except in cases where you need to control the assignment
of numbers, such as in the rate group example shown above.
In other cases, write `c.p` and let FPP infer
the zero index.
For example, this is what we did in the section on
<<Defining-Topologies_Connection-Graphs_Direct-Graph-Specifiers,
direct graph specifiers>>.

==== Matched Numbering

*Automatic matching:*
After resolving
<<Defining-Topologies_Port-Numbering_Explicit-Numbering,
explicit numbering>>, the FPP translator applies
*matched numbering*.
In this step, the translator numbers all pairs of
<<Defining-Components_Matched-Ports,matched ports>>.

Matched numbering is essential for resolving the command and health
<<Defining-Topologies_Connection-Graphs_Pattern-Graph-Specifiers,
patterns>>, each of which has matched ports.
You can also use matched numbering in conjunction with direct
graph specifiers.
For example, the Ref topology contains the following connections:

[source,fpp]
--------
connections Sequencer {
  cmdSeq.comCmdOut -> cmdDisp.seqCmdBuff
  cmdDisp.seqCmdStatus -> cmdSeq.cmdResponseIn
}

connections Uplink {
  ...
  uplink.comOut -> cmdDisp.seqCmdBuff
  cmdDisp.seqCmdStatus -> uplink.cmdResponseIn
  ...
}
--------

The port `cmdDisp.seqCmdBuff` port of the command dispatcher receives
command input from the command sequencer or from the ground.
The corresponding command response goes out on
port `cmdDisp.seqCmdStatus`.
These two ports are matched in the definition of the Command
Sequencer component.

When you use matched numbering with direct graph specifiers, you
must obey the following rules:

. When a component has the matching specifier
`match p1 with p2`, for every connection between `p1`
and another component, there must be a corresponding
connection between that other component and `p2`.

. You can use explicit numbering, and the automatic matching
will work around the numbers you supply if it can.
However, you may not do this in a way that makes the matching impossible.
For example, you may not connect `p1[0]` to another component
and `p2[1]` to the same component, because this connection
forces a mismatch.

If you violate these rules, you will get an error during
analysis.

*Manual matching:*
Automatic matched numbering works when each matched pair of connections
goes between the same two components, one of which
has a matched pair of ports.
If the matching does not follow this pattern, then automatic matched
numbering will not work, and you will need to use explicit port
numbers to express the matching.
For example, the Ref topology contains these connections:

[source,fpp]
--------
comm.allocate -> staticMemory.bufferAllocate[Ports.StaticMemory.uplink]
comm.$recv -> uplink.framedIn
uplink.framedDeallocate -> staticMemory.bufferDeallocate[Ports.StaticMemory.uplink]
--------

In this case the `staticMemory` instance requires that pairs of
allocation and deallocation requests for the same memory
go to the same port.
But the allocation request comes from `comm`,
and the deallocation request comes from `uplink`.
Since the allocation and deallocation connections go to different
component instances, we can't used automatic matched numbering.
Instead we define a symbolic constant `Ports.StaticMemory.uplink`
and use that twice to do the matching by hand.

==== General Numbering

After resolving 
<<Defining-Topologies_Port-Numbering_Explicit-Numbering,
explicit numbering>> and
<<Defining-Topologies_Port-Numbering_Matched-Numbering,
matched numbering>>,
the FPP translator applies
*general numbering*.
In this step, the translator uses the following algorithm to
fill in any remaining unassigned
port numbers:

. Traverse the connections in a deterministic order.
The order is fully described in _The FPP Language Specification_.

. For each connection

.. If the output port number is unassigned, then set it to the
lowest available port number.

.. If the input port number is unassigned, then set it to zero.

For example, consider the following connections:

[source,fpp]
--------
a.p -> b.p
a.p -> c.p
--------

After general numbering, the connections could be numbered
as follows:

[source,fpp]
--------
a.p[0] -> b.p[0]
a.p[1] -> c.p[0]
--------


=== Importing Topologies

It is often useful to decompose a flight software project
into several topologies.
For example, a project might have the following topologies:

. A topology for command and data handling (CDH) with
components such as a command dispatcher, an event logger, a telemetry data 
base,
a parameter database, and components for managing files.

. Various subsystem topologies, for example power, thermal,
attitude control, etc.

. A release topology.

Each of the subsystem topologies might include the CDH topology.
The release topology might include the CDH topology
and each of the subsystem topologies.
Further, to enable modular testing, it is useful for 
each topology to be able to run on its own.

In FPP, the way we accomplish these goals is to *import*
one topology into another one.
In this section of the User Guide, we explain how to do that.

==== Importing Instances and Connections

To import a topology `A` into a topology `B`, you write
`import A` inside topology `B`, like this:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology B {
  
  import A

  ...

}
--------

You may add instances and connections as usual to `B`, as shown
by the dots.

When you do this, the FPP translator does the following:

. *Resolve `A`:* Resolve all pattern graph
specifiers in `A`, and resolve all explicit port numbers in `A`.
Call the resulting topology `T`.

. *Form the instances of `B`:*
Take the union of the instances specified in `T` and
the instances specified in `B`, counting any duplicates once.
These are the instances of `B`.

. *Form the connections of `B`:*
Take the union of the connection graphs specified in `T` and
the connection graphs specified in `B`.
If each of `T` and `B` has a connection between the same
ports, then each becomes a separate connection in `B`.

. *Resolve `B`:* Resolve the pattern graph specifies of `B`.
Apply matched numbering and general numbering to `B`.

For example, suppose topologies `A` and `B` are defined
as follows:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology A {

  instance a
  instance b

  connections C1 {
    a.p1 -> b.p
  }

}

topology B {

  import A

  instance c

  connections C1 {
    a.p1 -> c.p
  }

  connections C2 {
    a.p2 -> c.p
  }

}
--------

After import resolution, `B` is equivalent to this topology:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology B {

  instance a
  instance b
  instance c

  connections C1 {
    a.p1 -> b.p
    a.p1 -> c.p
  }

  connections C2 {
    a.p2 -> c.p
  }

}
--------

Notice that the `C1` connections of `A` are merged with the `C1`
connections of `B`.

==== Private Instances

Often when importing topology `A` into topology `B`, you
want to include one or more instances in `A` that exist just
for running `A`, but that you don't want imported into `B`.
For example, `A` could have an instance `cStub` which is a stub version of 
a component `c` that is fully implemented in `B`.
In this case

* When running `A` you may need `cStub`; the topology
may not run or may not even compile without it.

* When importing `A` into `B` you don't want to import
`cStub`, because it is superseded by the real implementation `c` in `B`.
Also, any connections to `cStub` in `A` should be replaced
by connections to `c` in `B`.

To handle this case, you can make `cStub` a *private* instance
of `A` and `c` an instance of `B`.
When you import `B` into `A`, `cStub` will not become an instance
of `B`.
Further, no connections in `A` involving `cStub` will be imported
into `B`.

As an example, suppose we revise topology `A` from the previous
section as follows:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology A {

  instance a
  instance b
  private instance d

  connections C1 {
    a.p1 -> b.p
  }

  connections C2 {
    a.p1 -> d.p
  }

}
--------

Notice that we have added an instance `d` to topology
`A`, and we have declared `d` private to `A`.
We have also added a new connection to `d` in the
connection graph `C2`.

Now suppose that we use the same definition of `B` given 
in the previous section.
After import resolution, `B` will still be equivalent
to the topology shown at the end of the last section:
we have added an instance and a connection to `A`,
but the instance is private and the connection goes
from a private instance, so neither the instance nor
the connection is imported into `B`.

==== Multiple Imports

Multiple imports are allowed.
For example:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology A {

  import B
  import C

  ...

}
--------

This has the obvious meaning: both topology `B` and
topology `C` are imported into topology `A`, according
to the rules described above.

Each topology may appear at most once in the import list.
For example, this is incorrect:

[source,fpp]
--------
topology A {

  import B
  import B # Error: B imported twice

}
--------

==== Transitive Imports

In general, transitive imports are allowed.
For example, topology `A` may import topology `B`,
and topology `B` may import topology `C`.
Resolution works bottom-up on the import graph:
for example, first we resolve `C`, and then we resolve `B`,
and then we resolve `A`.

Cycles in the import graph are not allowed.
For example, if `A` imports `B` and `B` imports `C`
and `C` imports `A`, you will get an error.

=== Include Specifiers

You can include code from another file in a topology definition.
You do this by writing an *include specifier*.
We will explain more about this in the section on
<<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Include-Specifiers,include specifiers>>
below.
