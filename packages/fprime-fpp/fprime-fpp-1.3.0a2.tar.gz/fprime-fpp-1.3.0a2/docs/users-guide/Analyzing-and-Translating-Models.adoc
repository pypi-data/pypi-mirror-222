== Analyzing and Translating Models

The previous section explained how to specify an FPP model
as a collection of files:
how to divide a model into source files and how to compute the
dependencies of one or more files on other files.
This section explains the next step: how to perform analysis and
translation on part or all of an FPP model, after specifying
the model and computing its dependencies.

=== Checking Models

It is often useful to check a model for correctness, without
doing any translation.
The tool for checking models is called `fpp-check`.
If you provide one or more files as arguments, `fpp-check`
will attempt to read those files.
For example:

----
% fpp-check file1.fpp file2.fpp
----

If there are no arguments, then `fpp-check` reads from standard input.
For example:

----
% cat file1.fpp file2.fpp | fpp-check
----

If you run `fpp-check` with no arguments on the command line,
it will block and wait for standard input.
This is useful for interactive sessions, where you want
to type simple model text into the console and immediately check it.
`fpp-check` will keep reading input until (1) it encounters a parse error (more 
on this below); or (2) you terminate the input with control-D (which must be 
the first character in a line); or (3)
you terminate the program with control-C.

For larger models, the usual procedure for running `fpp-check` is as follows:

. Identify one or more files _F_ that you want to check.
. <<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Computing-Dependencies,Compute the dependencies>> _D_ of _F_.
. Run `fpp-check` _D_ _F_.

All the files _D_ and all the files _F_ are specified as file arguments,
separated by spaces.

When you run `fpp-check`, the following occurs:

. The tool parses all the input files, recursively resolving 
<<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Include-Specifiers,include specifiers>> as it goes.
If there are any parse errors or any problems resolving include files (for 
example, a missing file), it prints an error message to standard error and 
halts with nonzero status.

. If parsing succeeds, then the tool runs semantic analysis.
If everything checks out, the tool silently returns zero status.
Otherwise it prints an error message to standard error and
halts with nonzero status.

*Checking for unconnected port instances:*
It is often useful to check for port instances that appear
in a topology but that have no connections.
For example, the following is a useful procedure for adding component instances
and connections to a topology:

. Add the component instances.
In general this will introduce new port instances,
which will initially be unconnected.

. Check for unconnected port instances.

. Add some or all of the connections identified
in step 2.

. Rerun steps 2 and 3 until there are no more
missing connections, or you are certain that the
missing connections are valid for your design.

To check for unconnected port instances (step 2 in the procedure above),
run `fpp-check` with the option `-u` _file_, where _file_ is
the name of an output file.
`fpp-check` will write the names of all unconnected port instances
to the file.
For this purpose, a port instance array is considered unconnected
if none of its port numbers are connected.

For example:

[source]
----
% fpp-check -u unconnected.txt
port P

passive component C {
  sync input port pIn: P
  output port pOut: [2] P
}

instance c: C base id 0x100

topology T1 {

  instance c

}

topology T2 {

  instance c

  connections C {
    c.pOut -> c.pIn
  }

}
^D
% cat unconnected.txt
Topology T1:
  c.pIn
  c.pOut

----

In this example, component instance `c` has the following port instances:

* Two output port instances `c.pOut[0]` and `c.pOut[1]`.

* One input port instance `c.pIn`.

Topology `T1` uses instance `c` and does not connect any port number of
`c.pOut` or `c.pIn`.
So the output written to `unconnected.txt` reports that fact.
On the other hand, in topology `T2`, both `c.pOut` and `c.pIn`
are considered connected (so not reported as unconnected)
even though `c.Out` has two ports and only one of them is connected.


=== Generating XML

There are two reasons for generating XML from FPP:

. It is needed to support the F Prime GDS.

. It is needed to support {cpp} code generation, until we fully
replace the XML-to-{cpp} code generation with FPP-to-{cpp}
code generation (see the next section).

*XML file names:* The table <<xml-file-names>> shows how FPP definitions are 
translated to F Prime XML files.

[[xml-file-names]]
.XML File Names
|===
|FPP Definition|F Prime XML File

|Array _A_ outside any component|_A_ `ArrayAi.xml`
|Array _A_ in component _C_|_C_ `_` _A_ `ArrayAi.xml`
|Enum _E_ outside any component|_E_ `EnumAi.xml`
|Enum _E_ in component _C_|_C_ `_` _E_ `EnumAi.xml`
|Struct _S_ outside any component|_S_ `SerializableAi.xml`
|Struct _S_ in component _C_|_C_ `_` _S_ `SerializableAi.xml`
|Port _P_|_P_ `PortAi.xml`
|Component _C_|_C_ `ComponentAi.xml`
|Topology _T_|_T_ `TopologyAppAi.xml`
|===

For example, consider the FPP array definition

[source,fpp]
----
array A = [3] U32
----

Outside of any component definition, this definition is translated to
an XML array with name `A` defined in a file `AArrayAi.xml`.
Inside the definition of component `C`, it is translated to
an XML array with name `C_A` defined in the file `C_AArrayAi.xml`.
In either case the namespace in the XML file is given by the enclosing
FPP modules, if any.
For example, the following code

[source,fpp]
----
module M {

  array A = [3] U32

}
----

becomes an array with name `A` and namespace `M` in file
`AArrayAi.xml`.


*Tool name:* The tool for translating FPP definitions to XML files
is called `fpp-to-xml`.

*Procedure:*
The usual procedure for running `fpp-to-xml` is as follows:

. Identify one or more files _F_ that you want to translate.
. <<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Computing-Dependencies,Compute the dependencies>> _D_ of _F_.
. If _D_ is empty, then run `fpp-to-xml` _F_.
. Otherwise run `fpp-to-xml -i` _D1_ `,` ... `,` _Dn_ _F_, where _Di_ are the
names of the dependencies.

For example, suppose you want to generate XML for the definitions in `c.fpp`,
If `c.fpp` has no dependencies, then run

----
% fpp-to-xml c.fpp
----

On the other hand, if `c.fpp` depends on `a.fpp` and `b.fpp`, then run

----
% fpp-to-xml -i a.fpp,b.fpp c.fpp
----

Notice that you provide the dependencies as a comma-separated list of
arguments to the option `-i`.
`-i` stands for "import."
This option tells the tool that you want to read the files in _D_ for their symbols,
but you don't want to translate them.
Only the files _F_ provided as arguments are translated.

*Tool behavior:* When you run `fpp-to-xml`, the following occurs:

. The tool runs the same analysis 
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Checking-Models,as for `fpp-check`>>.
If there is any problem, the tool prints an error message to 
standard error and halts with nonzero status.

. If the analysis succeeds, then the tool generates XML files, one
for each definition appearing in _F_, with names as shown in the table above.
The files are written to the current directory.

*Generated import paths:*
When one FPP definition `A` depends on another definition `B`,
the generated XML file for `A` contains an XML node that imports
the generated XML file for `B`.
The tool constructs the import path from the
<<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Locating-Definitions,location>> of the imported FPP symbol.

For example, suppose the file `[path prefix]/A/A.fpp` contains the following
definition, where `[path prefix]` represents the path prefix of directory
`A` starting from the root of the file system:

[source,fpp]
--------
array A = [3] B
--------

And suppose the file `[path prefix]/B/B.fpp` contains the following definition:

[source.fpp]
----
array B = [3] U32
----

If you run this command in directory `[path prefix]/A`

----
% fpp-to-xml -i ../B/B.fpp A.fpp
----

then in that directory the tool will generate a file `AArrayAi.xml` containing 
the following line:

[source,xml]
----
<import_array_type>[path prefix]/B/BArrayAi.xml</import_array_type>
----

*Removing path prefixes:*
Usually when generating XML we don't want to include the system-specific part 
of the path prefix.
Instead, we want the path to be specified relative to some known place, for 
example
the root of the F Prime repository or a project repository.

To remove the prefix _prefix_ from generated paths, use the option
`-p` _prefix_ .
To continue the previous example, running

----
fpp-to-xml -i ../B/B.fpp -p [path prefix] A.fpp
----

generates a file `AArrayAi.xml` containing the line

[source,xml]
----
<import_array_type>B/BArrayAi.xml</import_array_type>
----

Notice that the path prefix `[path prefix]/` has been removed.

To specify multiple prefixes, separate them with commas:

----
fpp-to-xml -p prefix1,prefix2, ...
----

For each generated path, the tool will delete the longest prefix
that matches a prefix in the list.

*More options:* The following additional options are available
when running `fpp-to-xml`:

* `-d` _dir_ : Use _dir_ instead of the current directory as 
the output directory for writing files.
For example,
+
----
fpp-to-xml -d xml ...
----
+
writes output files
to the directory `xml` (which must already exist).

* `-n` _file_ : Write the names of the generated XML files
to _file_.
This is useful for collecting autocoder build dependencies.

* `-s` _size_ : Specify a default string size.
For example,
+
----
fpp-to-xml -s 40 ...
----
+
FPP allows string types with no specified size, and F Prime XML
does not.
So when generating code we need to provide a default size
to use when FPP doesn't specify the size.
If you don't specify the `-s` option, then the tool uses
an automatic default of 80.

*Standard input:* Instead of providing named files as arguments,
you can provide FPP source on standard input, as described
for <<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Checking-Models,`fpp-check`>>.

*XML limitations:* The XML translation has several
limitations.
For more information, see the text marked *XML limitations* elsewhere
in this manual.

=== Generating C Plus Plus

To date we have implemented all of the FPP to {cpp} translation
except for the generation of component unit test harnesses.

*Tool name:* The tool for translating FPP to {cpp} is called
`fpp-to-cpp`.

*Procedure:* 
The usual procedure for running `fpp-to-cpp` is as follows:

. Identify one or more files _F_ that you want to translate.
. <<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Computing-Dependencies,Compute the dependencies>> _D_ of _F_.
. If _D_ is empty, then run `fpp-to-cpp` _F_.
. Otherwise run `fpp-to-cpp -i` _D1_ `,` ... `,` _Dn_ _F_, where _Di_ are the
names of the dependencies.

Except for the tool name, this procedure is identical to the one given for 
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-XML,generating XML>>.
See that section for examples of the procedure.

*Input:* As with the tools described above, you can provide input to 
`fpp-to-cpp`
either through named files or through standard input.

==== Constant Definitions

`fpp-to-cpp` extracts <<Defining-Constants,constant definitions>>
from the source files _F_.
It generates files `FppConstantsAc.hpp` and `FppConstantsAc.cpp`
containing {cpp} translations of the constants.
By including and/or linking against these files,
you can use constants defined in the FPP model
in your FSW implementation code.

To keep things simple, only numeric, string, and Boolean constants are 
translated;
struct and array constants are ignored.
For example, the following constant is not translated, because
it is an array:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
----

To translate array constants, you must expand them to values
that are translated, like this:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a0 = 1
constant a1 = 2
constant a2 = 3
constant a = [ a0, a1, a2 ]
----

Constants are translated as follows:

* Integer constants become enumeration constants.
* Floating-point constants become `const` floating-point variables.
* `bool` point constants become `const bool` variables.
* `string` constants become `const char* const` variables initialized
with string literals.

As an example, try this:

----
% fpp-to-cpp
@ Constant a
constant a = 1
@ Constant b
constant b = 2.0
@ Constant c
constant c = true
@ Constant d
constant d = "abcd"
^D
----

You should see files `FppConstantsAc.hpp` and `FppConstantsAc.cpp`
in the current directory.
Examine them to confirm your understanding of how the translation
works.
Notice how the FPP annotations are translated to comments.
(We also remarked on this in the section on 
<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,writing annotations>>.)

*Constants defined inside components:*
As noted in the section on
<<Defining-Components_Constants-and-Types,defining components>>,
when you define a constant `c` inside a component `C`,
the name of the corresponding constant in the generated {cpp}
code is `C_c`.
As an example, run the following code through `fpp-to-cpp`
and examine the results:

[source,fpp]
----
passive component C {

  constant c = 0

}
----

*Generated header paths:*
The option `-p` _path-prefixes_ removes the longest of one or more
path prefixes from any generated header paths (for example,
the path to `FppConstants.hpp` that is included in `FppConstants.cpp`).
To specify multiple prefixes, separate them with commas (and no spaces).
This is similar to the `-p` option for
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-XML, `fpp-to-xml`>>.

*The include guard prefix:* By default, the include guard
for `FppConstantsAc.hpp` is _guard-prefix_ `pass:[_]FppConstantsAc_HPP`,
where _guard-prefix_ is the absolute path of the current
directory, after replacing non-identifier characters with underscores.
For example, if the current directory is `/home/user`, then
the guard prefix is `pass:[_]home_user`, and the include guard is
`pass:[_]home_user_FppConstantsAc_HPP`.

The `-p` option, if present, is applied to the guard
prefix.
For example, if you run `fpp-to-cpp -p $PWD ...` then
the guard prefix will be empty.
In this case, the guard is `FppConstantsAc_HPP`.

If you wish to use a different prefix entirely, use the option
`-g` _guard-prefix_.
For example, if you run `fpp-to-cpp -g Commands ...`,
then the include guard will be `Commands_FppConstantsAc_HPP`.

*More options:* The following additional options are available
when running `fpp-to-cpp`:

* `-d` _dir_ : Use _dir_ instead of the current directory as 
the output directory for writing files.
This is similar to the `-d` option for
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-XML, `fpp-to-xml`>>.

* `-n` _file_ : Write the names of the generated XML files
to _file_.
This is similar to the `-n` option for
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-XML, `fpp-to-xml`>>.

==== Topology Definitions

`fpp-to-cpp` also extracts <<Defining-Topologies,topology definitions>>
from the source files.
For each topology _T_ defined in the source files, `fpp-to-cpp`
writes files _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp` and _T_ `TopologyAc.cpp`.
These files define two public functions:
`setup` for setting up the topology, and
`teardown`, for tearing down the topology.
The function definitions come from the definition of _T_ and
from the
<<Defining-Component-Instances_Init-Specifiers, init specifiers>>
for the component instances used in _T_.
You can call these functions from a handwritten `main`
function.
We will explain how to write this `main` function in the
section on 
<<Writing-C-Plus-Plus-Implementations_Implementing-Deployments,
implementing deployments>>.

As an example, you can do the following:

* On the command line, run `fpp-to-cpp -p $PWD`.

* Copy the text of the <<Defining-Topologies_A-Simple-Example,
simple topology example>> and paste it into the terminal.

* Press return, control-D, and return.

* Examine the generated files `SimpleTopologyAc.hpp`
and `SimpleTopologyAc.cpp`.

You can examine the files `RefTopologyAc.hpp` and `RefTopologyAc.cpp`
in the F Prime repository.
Currently these files are checked in at `Ref/Top`.
Once we have integrated FPP with CMake, these files will be auto-generated
by CMake and will be located at `Ref/build-fprime-automatic-native/F-Prime/Ref/Top`.

*Options:*
When translating topologies,
the `-d`, `-n`, and `-p` options work in the same way as for
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-C-Plus-Plus_Constant-Definitions,
translating constant definitions>>.
The `-g` option is ignored, because
the include guard prefix comes from the name of the topology.

==== Types, Ports, and Components

{cpp} code generation for types, ports, and components works similarly
to the corresponding code generation from XML.
This code generation is described
in the https://github.com/nasa/fprime/blob/master/docs/UsersGuide/guide.md[F 
Prime User's Guide].

==== Component Implementation Templates

`fpp-to-cpp` has an option `-t`.
When you run `fpp-to-cpp` with this option, it does not
generate any autocoded {cpp} for constants, ports, types, components, or
topologies.
Instead, for each component definition _C_ in the input,
 it generates files _C_ `.template.hpp` and _C_ `.template.cpp`.
These files provide a "template" or partial implementation that you
can fill in to provide the concrete implementation of _C_.

=== Identifying Generated Files

As discussed in the previous section, the `-n` option
of `fpp-to-xml` and `fpp-to-cpp` lets you collect the names of
files generated from an FPP model as those files are generated.
However, sometimes you need to know the names of the generated
files up front.
For example, the CMake build tool writes out a Makefile rule
for every generated file, and it does this as an initial step
before generating any files.

In this case, you can use the tool `fpp-filenames`.
Like `fpp-check`, `fpp-filenames` reads the files
provided as command-line arguments if there are any;
otherwise it reads from standard input.
The FPP source presented to `fpp-filenames` need not be a complete
model (i.e., it may contain undefined symbols).
The tool parses the FPP source that you give it.
It identifies all definitions in the source that would cause
XML files to be generated when running `fpp-to-xml`
or would cause {cpp} files to be generated when running
`fpp-to-cpp`.
Then it writes the names of those files to standard output.

For example:

----
% fpp-filenames
array A = [3] U32
^D
AArrayAi.xml
----

----
% fpp-filenames
constant a = 0
^D
FppConstantsAc.cpp
FppConstantsAc.hpp
----

Alternatively, you can use the option `-g` _file_ to
<<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Computing-Dependencies,`fpp-depend`>>.
This option writes the generated file names to the file _file_
as part of the dependency analysis.
For example:

----
% fpp-depend -g generated.txt
array A = [3] U32
^D
% cat generated.txt
AArrayAi.xml
----

The output is the same as for `fpp-filenames`, but this way you can
run one tool (`fpp-depend`) instead of two (`fpp-depend` and
`fpp-filenames`).
Since FPP is implemented in Scala, and there is some overhead
associated with starting up a tool, running `fpp-depend -g` _file_ 
may help your build go faster.

=== Translating XML to FPP

The FPP tool suite provides a capability to translate F Prime
XML files to FPP.
Its purpose is to address the following case:

. You have already developed an F Prime model in XML.
. You wish to translate the model to FPP in order to use FPP as the source 
language going forward.

The XML-to-FPP translation is designed to do most of the work in translating an 
XML model into FPP.
As discussed below, some manual effort will still be required,
because the FPP and XML representations are not identical.
The good news is that this is a one-time effort: you can do it once
and use the FPP version thereafter.

*Tool name:* The tool for translating XML to FPP is called
`fpp-from-xml`.

*Tool behavior:*
Unlike the tools described above, `fpp-from-xml` does not read
from standard input.
To use it, you must name one or more XML files on the command line.
The reason is that the XML parsing library used by the tool requires
named files.
The tool reads the XML files you name, translates them, and
writes the result to standard output.

As an example, try this:

----
% fpp-to-xml
struct S { x: U32, y: F32 }
^D
% fpp-from-xml SSerializableAi.xml 
struct S {
  x: U32
  y: F32
}
----

*Default values:*
There are two issues to note in connection with translating default 
values.

First, in FPP, every definition has a default value, but
the default value need not be given explicitly:
if you provide no explicit default value, then an implicit default is used.
By contrast, in F Prime XML, (1) you _must_ supply default values for array
elements, and (2) you _may_ supply default values for struct members
or enumerations. 
To keep the translation simple, if default values are present in the XML
representation, then `fpp-from-xml` translates them to explicit values,
even if they could be made implicit.

Here is an example:

----
% fpp-to-xml
array A = [3] U32
^D
% fpp-from-xml AArrayAi.xml
array A = [3] U32 default [
                            0
                            0
                            0
                          ]
----

Notice that the implicit default value `[ 0, 0, 0 ]` becomes
explicit when translating to XML and back to FPP.

Second, to keep the translation simple, only literal numeric values,
literal string values, literal Boolean values, and {cpp} qualified identifiers 
(e.g., `a` or `A::B`) are translated.
Other values (e.g., values specified with {cpp} constructor calls), are not translated.
The reason is that the types of these values cannot be easily inferred from the 
XML representation.
When a default value is not translated, the translator inserts an annotation
identifying what was not translated, so that you can do the translation
yourself.

For example, try this:

----
% fpp-to-xml
type T
array A = [3] T  
^D
% fpp-from-xml AArrayAi.xml 
@ FPP from XML: could not translate array value [ T(), T(), T() ]
array A = [3] T
----

The tool cannot translate the value `T()`.
So it adds an annotation stating that.
In this case, `T()` is the default value associated with the
abstract type `T`, so using the implicit default is correct.
So in this case, just delete the annotation.

Here is another example:

----
% fpp-to-xml
array A = [2] U32
array B = [2] A default [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]
^D
% fpp-from-xml BArrayAi.xml
@ FPP from XML: could not translate array value [ A(1, 2), A(3, 4) ]
array B = [2] A
----

Here the XML representation of the array values `[ 1, 2 ]` and `[ 3, 4 ]`
uses the {cpp} constructor calls `A(1, 2)` and `A(3, 4)`.
When translating `BArrayAi.xml`, `fpp-from-xml` doesn't know how to translate 
those values, because it doesn't have any information about the type `A`.
So it omits the FPP default array value and reports the XML default element 
values in the annotation.
That way, you can manually construct a default value in FPP.

*Inline enum definitions:*
The following F Prime XML formats may include inline
enum definitions:

* In the Serializable XML format,
enumerations may appear as member types.

* In the Port XML format, enumerations may appear
as the types of arguments or as the return type.

* In the XML formats for commands and for events, 
enumerations may appear as the types of arguments.

* In the XML formats for telemetry channels and for
parameters, enumerations may appear as the types of
data elements.

In each case, the enumerated constants are specified 
as part of the definition of the member, argument, return type, etc.

FPP does not represent these inline enum definitions directly.
In FPP, enum definitions are always named, so they can be reused.
Therefore, when translating an F Prime XML file that contains inline enum 
definitions, `fpp-to-xml` does the following: (1) translate
each inline definition to a named FPP enum; and (2) use the corresponding named 
types in the translated FPP struct or port.

For example, here is an F Prime Serializable XML type
`N::S1` containing a member `m` whose type is an enum
`E` with three enumerated constants `A`, `B`, and `C`:

----
cat > S1SerializableAi.xml
<serializable namespace="N" name="S1">
  <members>
    <member name="m" type="ENUM">
      <enum name="E">
        <item name="A"/>
        <item name="B"/>
        <item name="C"/>
      </enum>
    </member>
  </members>
</serializable>
^D
----

(The formula `cat >` _file_ lets us enter input to
the console and have it written to _file_.)

Running `fpp-from-xml` on this file yields the following:

----
% fpp-from-xml S1SerializableAi.xml
module N {

  enum E {
    A = 0
    B = 1
    C = 2
  }

  struct S1 {
    m: E
  }

}
----

Notice the following:

. The tool translates namespace `N` in XML to module `N` in FPP.

. The tool translates Serializable type `S1` in namespace `N`
to struct type `S1` in module `N`.

. The tool generates an enum type `N.E` to represent the
type of member `m` of struct `N.S1`.

. The tool assigns member `m` of struct `N.S1` the type `N.E`.

If you wish to translate an XML model to FPP, and that model contains
inline enums, then we suggest the following procedure:

. Run `fpp-from-xml` on the XML model as described above to convert all of the
inline definitions to named XML types.

. Refactor your XML model and FSW implementation to use the XML types generated 
in step 1.
This may require changes to your {cpp} code.
For example, inline XML enums and XML enum types generate
slightly different code.
Therefore, you will need to revise any
uses of the old inline enums to match the new format.
Do this step incrementally, making sure that all your regression tests pass at 
each step.

. Once you have the XML model in the required form, run `fpp-from-xml`
again to generate an FPP model _M_.
If you have done step 2 correctly, then you should be able to
replace your handwritten XML with the result of running `fpp-to-xml`
on _M_.

*Format strings:*
`fpp-from-xml` translates XML format strings to FPP
format strings, if it can.
Here is an example:

----
% fpp-to-xml
array A = [3] F32 format "{f}"
^D
----

This will generate a file `AArrayAi.xml` containing the line

----
<format>%f</format>
----

which is the XML representation of the format.

Now try this:

----
% fpp-from-xml AArrayAi.xml
array A = [3] F32 default [
                            0.0
                            0.0
                            0.0
                          ] format "{f}"
----

The XML format `%f` is translated back to the FPP format `{f}`.

If the tool cannot translate the format, it will insert an annotation
stating that. For example, `%q` is not a format recognized by
FPP, so a format containing this string won't be translated:

----
% cat > AArrayAi.xml
<array name="A">
  <type>F32</type>
  <size>1</size>
  <format>%q</format>
  <default>
    <value>0.0</value>
  </default>
</array>
^D
% fpp-from-xml AArrayAi.xml 
@ FPP from XML: could not translate format string "%q"
array A = [1] F32 default [
                            0.0
                          ]
----

*Import directives:*
XML directives that import symbols (such as `import_port_type`)
are ignored in the translation.
These directives represent dependencies between XML files, which
become dependencies between FPP source files in the FPP translation.
Once the XML-to-FPP translation is done, you can handle these
dependencies in the ordinary way for FPP, as discussed in the
section on <<Specifying-Models-as-Files,specifying models as files>>.

XML directives that import XML dictionaries are translated
to 
<<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Include-Specifiers,include specifiers>>.
For example, suppose that `CComponentAi.xml` defines component `C`
and contains the directive

[source,xml]
----
<import_dictionary>Commands.xml</import_dictionary>
----

Running `fpp-from-xml` on `CComponentAi.xml` produces an
FPP definition of a component `C`; the component definition
contains the include specifier

[source,fpp]
-----
include "Commands.fppi"
-----

Separately, you can use `fpp-to-xml` to translate `Commands.xml`
to `Commands.fppi`.

=== Formatting FPP Source

The tool `fpp-format` accepts FPP source files as input
and rewrites them as formatted output.
You can use this tool to put your source files into
a standard form.

For example, try this:

----
% fpp-format
array A = [3] U32 default [ 1, 2, 3 ]
^D
array A = [3] U32 default [
                            1
                            2
                            3
                          ]
----

`fpp-format` has reformatted the default value so that each array
element is on its own line.

By default, `fpp-format` does not resolve include specifiers.
For example:

----
% echo 'constant a = 0' > a.fppi
% fpp-format
include "a.fppi"
^D
include "a.fppi"
----

The `-i` option causes `fpp-format` to resolve include specifiers.
For example:

----
% echo 'constant a = 0' > a.fpp
% fpp-format -i
include "a.fppi"
^D
constant a = 0
----

`fpp-format` has one big limitation: it goes through
the FPP parser, so it deletes all
<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Comments,comments>>
from the program
(<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,annotations>>
are preserved).
To preserve comments on their own lines that precede
annotatable elements, you can run this script:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
sed 's/^\( *\)#/\1@ #/' | fpp-format $@ | sed 's/^\( *\)@ #/\1#/'
----

It converts comments to annotations, runs `fpp-format`, and converts the 
annotations back to comments.

=== Visualizing Topologies

When FPP translates a topology _T_ to XML, as discussed in the section on
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-XML,generating XML>>,
it adds special comments that can be read by a companion tool called
`fprime-layout`.
`fprime-layout` reads a topology XML file and produces a
*topology visualization*, i.e., a graphical rendering of the topology
in which the component instances are shapes, the ports are smaller shapes,
and the connections are arrows between the ports.
`fprime-layout` produces one visualization for each
<<Defining-Topologies_Connection-Graphs,connection graph>> in the 
topology.

Topology visualization is an important part of the FPP work flow:

* It provides a graphical representation of the instances and
connections in each connection graph.
This graphical representation is a useful complement to the
textual representation provided by the FPP source.

* It makes explicit information that is only implicit in the
FPP source, e.g., the auto-generated port numbers of the connections and
the auto-generated connections of the pattern graph specifiers.

Using `fprime-layout`, you can do the following:

* Extract the connection graphs from a topology XML file.

* Render the connection graphs as EPS (Encapsulated PostScript),
generating one EPS file for each connection graph.

* Generate a set of layouts, one for each connection graph,
and view the layouts in a browser.

repository] for more details.
