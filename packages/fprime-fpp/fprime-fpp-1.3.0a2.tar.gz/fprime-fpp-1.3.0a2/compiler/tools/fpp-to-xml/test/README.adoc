== fpp-to-xml/test

This is the test directory for the `fpp-to-xml` tool.

=== Running Tests

To run the tests, execute `./test` in this directory.
All the tests should pass.

=== Developing Tests

When developing tests, run the tool `./check-xml`.
This ensures that all the `*.ref.xml` files are valid F Prime XML files
that produce valid {cpp} files when run through the F Prime code generator.

Before running `check-xml`, do the following:

* Check out a copy of the 
https://github.com/nasa/fprime[F Prime repository].

* Set the shell environment variable `FPRIME` to point to
the root of the F Prime repository.
