=== Array Expressions

An *array expression* is an expression that represents an array value.

==== Syntax

`[` _array-element-sequence_ `]`

_array-element-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in which the elements
are
<<Expressions,expressions>>, and the terminating punctuation
is a comma.

==== Semantics

. The sequence must have at least one element.

. The types of the expressions in the sequence must be
<<Type-Checking_Computing-a-Common-Type_Lists-of-Types,
convertible to a common type>>.

. The value of the expression is formed by computing
the value of each element and then converting all the
elements to the common type.
