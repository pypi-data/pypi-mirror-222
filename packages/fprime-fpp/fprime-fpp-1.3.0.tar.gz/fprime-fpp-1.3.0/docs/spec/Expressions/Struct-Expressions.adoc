=== Struct Expressions

An *struct expression* is an expression that represents a struct value.

==== Syntax

`{` _struct-element-sequence_ `}`

_struct-element-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in which the elements
are struct elements, and the terminating punctuation is a comma.
A *struct element* has the following syntax:

<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> `=` <<Expressions,_expression_>>

==== Semantics

The following must be true of the struct element sequence _S_:

. No two identifiers appearing in _S_ may be the same.

. Each expression appearing in _S_ must have a valid type.

The expression is evaluated by evaluating each member expression
to a value and then constructing the struct value with the
corresponding member names and values.

==== Example

[source,fpp]
----
# s is a struct value with members x = 0, y = 1
constant s = { 
  x = 0
  y = 1
}
