=== Integer Literals

An *integer literal expression* is one of the following:

* A sequence of decimal digits `0` through `9` denoting the decimal
representation of a nonnegative integer.

* `0x` or `0X` followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits
`0` through `9`, `A` through `F`, or `a` through `f` denoting the hexadecimal 
representation of a nonnegative
integer.

An integer literal value stem:[v] is represented in the model as an integer of
arbitrary width.
During code generation, the width is narrowed (if necessary) to some machine width
less than or equal to 64 bits.
