== Writing C Plus Plus Implementations

When constructing an F Prime deployment in {cpp}, there are generally
four kinds of implementations you have to write:

. Implementations of
<<Defining-Types_Abstract-Type-Definitions,abstract types>>.
These are types that are named in the FPP model but are defined
directly in {cpp}.

. Implementations of
<<Defining-Components,components>>.

. Implementations of any libraries used by the component implementations,
e.g., algorithm libraries or hardware device driver libraries.

. A top-level implementation including a `main` function for running
the FSW application.

Implementing a component involves filling out the API provided by
the {cpp} component base class.
This process is covered in detail in the F Prime user's guide;
we won't cover it further here.
Similarly, implementing libraries is unrelated to FPP, so we
won't cover it in this manual.
Here we focus on items (1) and (4): implementing abstract types
and implementing deployments.

=== Implementing Abstract Types

Except for a few built-in types (see below), when translating to XML and then {cpp}, an
<<Defining-Types_Abstract-Type-Definitions,abstract type definition>>
represents a {cpp} class that you write directly in {cpp}.
When you use an abstract type _T_ in an FPP definition _D_ (for example, as the
member type of an array definition)
and you translate _D_ to {cpp}, then the generated {cpp} for _D_ contains an
`include` directive that includes a header file for _T_.

As an example, try this:

----
% fpp-to-cpp -p $PWD
type T
array A = [3] T
^D
----

Notice that we used the option `-p $PWD`.
This is to make the generated include path relative to the current directory.

Now run

----
% cat AArrayAc.hpp
----

You should see the following line in the generated {cpp}:

[source,cpp]
----
#include "T.hpp"
----

This line says that in order to compile `AArrayAc.cpp`, 
a header file `T.hpp` must exist in the current directory.
It is up to you to provide that header file.

When implementing an abstract type `T` in {cpp}, you must define
a class that extends `Fw::Serializable` from the F Prime framework.
Your class definition must include the following:

* An implementation of the virtual function
+
----
Fw::SerializeStatus T::serialize(Fw::SerializeBufferBase&) const
----
+
that specifies how to *serialize* a class instance (i.e., convert a class
instance to a byte string).

* An implementation of the function
+
----
Fw::SerializeStatus T::deserialize(Fw::SerializeBufferBase&)
----
+
that specifies how to *deserialize* a class instance (i.e., reconstruct a class
instance from a byte string).

* A constant `T::SERIALIZED_SIZE` that specifies the size in bytes
of a byte string serialized from the class.

* A zero-argument constructor `T()`.

* An overloaded equality operator
+
----
bool operator==(const T& that) const;
----

Here is a minimal complete implementation of an abstract type `T`.
It has one member variable `x` of type `U32` and no methods other than
those required by F Prime.
We have made `T` a {cpp} struct (rather than a class) so that
all members are public by default.

----
// A minimal implementation of abstract type T

#ifndef T_HPP
#define T_HPP

// Include Fw/Types/Serializable.fpp from the F Prime framework
#include "Fw/Types/Serializable.hpp"

struct T : public Fw::Serializable { // Extend Fw::Serializable

  // Define some shorthand for F Prime types
  typedef Fw::SerializeStatus SS;
  typedef Fw::SerializeBufferBase B;

  // Define the constant SERIALIZED_SIZE
  enum Constants { SERIALIZED_SIZE = sizeof(U32) };

  // Provide a zero-argument constructor
  T() : x(0) { }

  // Define a comparison operator
  bool operator==(const T& that) const { return this->x == that.x; }

  // Define the virtual serialize method
  SS serialize(B& b) const { return b.serialize(x); }

  // Define the virtual deserialize method
  SS deserialize(B& b) { return b.deserialize(x); }

  // Provide some data
  U32 x;

};

#endif
----

*Built-in types:*
The following types are abstract in the FPP model but are known to
the {cpp} translator:

----
FwBuffSizeType
FwChanIdType
FwEnumStoreType
FwEventIdType
FwIndexType
FwOpcodeType
FwPacketDescriptorType
FwPrmIdType
FwSizeType
FwTimeBaseStoreType
FwTimeContextStoreType
FwTlmPacketizeIdType
NATIVE_INT_TYPE
NATIVE_UINT_TYPE
POINTER_CAST
----

Each of these types is an alias for a {cpp} integer type, and each
has default value zero.

The F Prime framework provides the {cpp} definitions
for these types.
It also provides the corresponding abstract type definitions
in the FPP model; for a typical F Prime project, these
definitions are located at `config/FpConfig.fpp`.
You don't have to define header files for these types.

=== Implementing Deployments

At the highest level of an F Prime implementation, you write
two units of {cpp} code:

. Application-specific definitions visible
both to the `main` function and to the auto-generated
topology code.

. The `main` function.

We describe each of these code units below.

==== Application-Specific Definitions

As discussed in the section on
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-C-Plus-Plus_Topology-Definitions,
generating {cpp} topology definitions>>, when you translate an FPP
topology _T_ to {cpp}, the result goes into files
_T_ `TopologyAc.hpp` and _T_ `TopologyAc.cpp`.
The generated file _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp` includes a file
_T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp`.
The purpose of this file inclusion is as follows:

.  _T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp` is not auto-generated.
You must write it by hand as part of your {cpp} implementation.

. Because _T_ `TopologyAc.cpp` includes _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp`
and _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp` includes _T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp`,
the handwritten definitions in _T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp` are visible
to the auto-generated code in _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp` and
`TopologyAc.cpp`.

. You can also include _T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp` in your main
function (described in the next section) to make its
definitions visible there.
That way `main` and the auto-generated topology
code can share these custom definitions.

_T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp`
must be located in the same directory where the topology _T_ is defined.
When writing the file _T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp`, you should
follow the description given below.

*Topology state:*
_T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp` must define a type
`TopologyState` in the {cpp} namespace
corresponding to the FPP module where the topology _T_ is defined.
For example, in `SystemReference/Top/topology.fpp` in the
https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-system-reference/blob/main/SystemReference/Top/topology.fpp[F Prime system reference deployment], the FPP topology `SystemReference` is defined in the FPP
module `SystemReference`, and so in
https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-system-reference/blob/main/SystemReference/Top/SystemReferenceTopologyDefs.hpp[`SystemReference/Top/SystemReferenceTopologyDefs.hpp`], the type `TopologyState`
is defined in the namespace `SystemReference`.

`TopologyState` may be any type.
Usually it is a struct or class.
The {cpp} code generated by FPP passes a value `state` of type `TopologyState` into
each of the functions for setting up and tearing down topologies.
You can read this value in the code associated with your
<<Defining-Component-Instances_Init-Specifiers,
init specifiers>>.

In the F Prime system reference example, `TopologyState`
is a struct with two member variables: a C-style string
`hostName` that stores a host name and a `U32` value `portNumber`
that stores a port number.
The main function defined in `Main.cpp` parses the command-line
arguments to the application, uses the result to create an object
`state` of type `TopologyState`, and passes the `state` object
into the functions for setting up and tearing down the topology.
The `startTasks` phase for the `comDriver` instance uses the `state`
object in the following way:

[source,fpp]
--------
phase Fpp.ToCpp.Phases.startTasks """
// Initialize socket server if and only if there is a valid specification
if (state.hostName != nullptr && state.portNumber != 0) {
    Os::TaskString name("ReceiveTask");
    // Uplink is configured for receive so a socket task is started
    comDriver.configure(state.hostName, state.portNumber);
    comDriver.startSocketTask(
        name,
        true,
        ConfigConstants::comDriver::PRIORITY,
        ConfigConstants::comDriver::STACK_SIZE
    );
}
"""
--------

In this code snippet, the expressions `state.hostName` and `state.portNumber`
refer to the `hostName` and `portNumber` member variables of the
state object passed in from the main function.

The `state` object is passed in to the setup and teardown functions
via `const` reference.
Therefore, you may read, but not write, the `state` object in the
code associated with the init specifiers.

*Health ping entries:*
If your topology uses an instance of the standard component `Svc::Health` for
monitoring
the health of components with threads, then _T_ `TopologyDefs.hpp`
must define the *health ping entries* used by the health component instance.
The health ping entries specify the time in seconds to wait for the
receipt of a health ping before declaring a timeout.
For each component being monitored, there are two timeout intervals:
a warning interval and a fatal interval.
If the warning interval passes without a health ping, then a warning event occurs.
If the fatal interval passes without a health ping, then a fatal event occurs.

You must specify the health ping entries in the namespace corresponding
to the FPP module where _T_ is defined.
To specify the health ping entries, you do the following:

. Open a namespace `PingEntries`.

. In that namespace, open a namespace corresponding to the name
of each component instance with health ping ports.

. Inside namespace in item 2, define a {cpp} enumeration with
the following constants `WARN` and `FATAL`.
Set `WARN` equal to the warning interval for the enclosing
component instance.
Set `FATAL` equal to the fatal interval.

For example, here are the health ping entries from
`SystemReference/Top/SystemReferenceTopologyDefs.hpp`
in the F Prime system reference repository:

[source,cpp]
----
namespace SystemReference {

  ...

  // Health ping entries
  namespace PingEntries {
    namespace blockDrv { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace chanTlm { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace cmdDisp { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace cmdSeq { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace eventLogger { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace fileDownlink { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace fileManager { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace fileUplink { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace imageProcessor { enum {WARN = 3, FATAL = 5}; }
    namespace prmDb { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace processedImageBufferLogger { enum {WARN = 3, FATAL = 5}; }
    namespace rateGroup1Comp { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace rateGroup2Comp { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace rateGroup3Comp { enum { WARN = 3, FATAL = 5 }; }
    namespace saveImageBufferLogger { enum {WARN = 3, FATAL = 5}; }
  }

}
----

*Other definitions:*
You can put any compile-time definitions you wish into _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp`
If you need link-time definitions (e.g., to declare variables with storage),
you can put them in _T_ `TopologyAc.cpp`, but this is not required.

For example, `SystemReference/Top/SystemReferenceTopologyAc.hpp` declares
a variable `SystemReference::Allocation::mallocator` of type `Fw::MallocAllocator`.
It provides an allocator used in the setup and teardown
of several component instances.
The corresponding link-time symbol is defined in `SystemReferenceTopologyDefs.cpp`.

==== The Main Function

You must write a main function that performs application-specific
and system-specific tasks such as parsing command-line arguments,
handling signals, and returning a numeric code to the system on exit.
Your main code can use the following public interface provided
by _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp`:

[source,cpp]
----
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Public interface functions
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

//! Set up the topology
void setup(
    const TopologyState& state //!< The topology state
);

//! Tear down the topology
void teardown(
    const TopologyState& state //!< The topology state
);
----

These functions reside in the {cpp} namespace corresponding to
the FPP module where the topology _T_ is defined.

On Linux, a typical main function might work this way:

. Parse command-line arguments. Use the result to construct
a `TopologyState` object `state`.

. Set up a signal handler to catch signals.

. Call _T_ `::setup`, passing in the `state` object, to
construct and initialize the topology.

. Start the topology running, e.g., by looping in the main thread
until a signal is handled, or by calling a start function on a
timer component (see, e.g., `Svc::LinuxTimer`).
The loop or timer typically runs until a signal is caught, e.g.,
when the user presses control-C at the console.

. On catching a signal

.. Set a flag that causes the main loop to exit or the timer
to stop.
This flag must be a volatile and atomic variable (e.g.,
`std::atomic_bool`) because it is accessed
concurrently by signal handlers and threads.

.. Call _T_ `::teardown`, passing in the `state` object, to
tear down the topology.

.. Wait some time for all the threads to exit.

.. Exit the main thread.

For an example like this, see `SystemReference/Top/Main.cpp` in the
F Prime system reference repository.

==== Public Symbols

The header file _T_ `TopologyAc.hpp` declares several public
symbols that you can use when writing your main function.

*Instance variables:*
Each component instance used in the topology is declared as
an `extern` variable, so you can refer to any component instance
in the main function.
For example, the main function in the `SystemReference` topology
calls the method `callIsr` of the `blockDrv` (block driver)
component instance, in order to simulate an interrupt service
routine (ISR) call triggered by a hardware interrupt.

*Helper functions:*
The auto-generated `setup` function calls the following auto-generated
helper functions:

[source,cpp]
----
void initComponents(const TopologyState& state);
void configComponents(const TopologyState& state);
void setBaseIds();
void connectComponents();
void regCommands();
void readParameters();
void loadParameters();
void startTasks(const TopologyState& state);
----

The auto-generated `teardown` function calls the following
auto-generated helper functions:

[source,cpp]
----
void stopTasks(const TopologyState& state);
void freeThreads(const TopologyState& state);
void tearDownComponents(const TopologyState& state);
----

The helper functions are declared as public symbols in _T_
`TopologyAc.hpp`, so if you wish, you may write your own versions
of `setup` and `teardown` that call these functions directly.
The FPP modeling is designed so that you don't have to do this;
you can put any custom {cpp} code for setup or teardown into
<<Defining-Component-Instances_Init-Specifiers,init specifiers>>
and let the FPP translator generate complete `setup` and `teardown`
functions that you simply call, as described above.
Using init specifiers generally produces cleaner integration between
the model and the {cpp} code: you write the custom
{cpp} code once, any topology _T_ that uses an instance _I_ will pick
up the custom {cpp} code for _I_, and the FPP translator will automatically
put the code for _I_ into the correct place in _T_ `TopologyAc.cpp`.
However, if you wish to write the custom code directly into your main
function, you may.
