== fpp-to-cpp/test

This is the test directory for the `fpp-to-cpp` tool.

=== Running Tests

To run the tests, execute `./test` in this directory.
All the tests should pass.

=== Developing Tests

When developing tests, run the tool `check-cpp`.
This makes sure that all the `*.ref.cpp` files are valid {cpp} files.

Before running `check-cpp`, do the following:

. Clone the
https://github.com/nasa/fprime[F Prime repository]
and check out branch release/v3.0.0.

. Set the shell environment variable `FPRIME` to point to
the root of the F Prime repository.
