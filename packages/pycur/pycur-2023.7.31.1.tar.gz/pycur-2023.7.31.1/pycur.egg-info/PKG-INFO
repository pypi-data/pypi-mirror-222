*Modifying cursors is now easier than ever!*
## [Check out the pycur community](https://pycur.glitch.me)!

## Install
Installing `pycur` is easy! Just use the usual `pip install` command as shown here:
```sh
pip install pycur
```
You can adjust this command to fit your environment. :)
## Version check
```py
import pycur

print(pycur.__version__) # Outputs the installed version of `pycur`
```
## Save a blank cursor (TODO)
```py
import pycur

empt = pycur.Cursor("new", (32, 32))
empt.saveAs("blank.cur") # Easy as that! ;)
```
