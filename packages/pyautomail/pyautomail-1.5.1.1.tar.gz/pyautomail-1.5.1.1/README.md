Welcome to the documentation for automail, a powerful Python package designed
for automated email sending, especially tailored for large scale operations
and Gmail automation. In today's fast-paced digital world, effective email
communication is a vital aspect of many businesses and projects.
However, manually sending individual emails or even managing bulk
email campaigns can be time-consuming and error-prone.


## Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/msinamsina/automail.git
```

## How to use in command-line interface
At first, you should register your email address and contact list
```bash
automail register <your-email-address> <Path-to-your-contact-list> [options]
```
Then you can send email to your contact list
```bash
automail start <process-id>
```
## How to use in python
```python
    from automail import EmailSender
    email_sender = EmailSender()
    email_sender.set_template('body.txt')
    data = {'name': 'Jon', 'age': 30}
    email_sender.send('msinamsina@gmail.com', 'sub1', data)
```
