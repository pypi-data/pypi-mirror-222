﻿# Redfin Scraper

## Description
A scalable Python library that leverages Redfin's unofficial Stringray API to quickly scrape real estate data.

## One-Time Setup
### Zip Code Database
> A database of zip codes is required to search for City, State values  

> It is strongly recommended to download this [free](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/#) version in .csv format
### The Config
> Parameters for the RedfinScraper class can be controlled using an optional `config.json` file  

> [Sample Config](https://github.com/ryansherby/RedfinScraper/blob/main/config.json)



## Getting Started
### Installation
`pip3 install -U redfin-scraper`

### Import Module
`from redfin_scraper import RedfinScraper`  

### Initialize Module
`scraper = RedfinScraper()`

## Using The Scraper
### Required Setup
`scraper.setup(zip_database_path:str, multiprocessing:bool=False)`

> **zip_database_path**: Binary path to the zip_code_database.csv  

> **multiprocessing**: Allow for multiprocessing

### Activating The Scraper
`scraper.scrape(city_states:list[str]=None, zip_codes:list[str], sold:bool=False, sale_period:str=None, lat_tuner:float=1.5, lon_tuner:float=1.5)`
>**city_states**: List of strings representing US cities formatted as "City, State"  

>**zip_codes**: List of strings representing US zip codes  

>**sold**: Select whether to scrape for-sale data (default) or sold data  

>**sale_period**: Must be selected whenever sold is True (1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1yr, 3yr, 5yr)

>**lat_tuner**: Represents # of standard deviations beyond the local latitude average that a zip code may exist within   

>**lon_tuner**: Represents # of standard deviations beyond the local longitude average that a zip code may exist within  

### Accessing Prior Scrapes
`scraper.get_data(id:str)`
>**id**: IDs are indexed at 1 and increase in the format "D00#"

## Appendix
### Warnings
> Multiprocessing can result in the consumption of all available CPU resources for an extended period of time  

> Unethical use of this library can result in Redfin taking disciplinary action against your IP address  

### Recommendations
> Requests for large amounts of data (# of zip codes > 2,000) should be split into separate requests  

> The `package.log` file can be used to investigate unexpected results
