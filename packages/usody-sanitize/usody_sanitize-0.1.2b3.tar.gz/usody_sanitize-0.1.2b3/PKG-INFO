# Usody Sanitize

> Under development.

This tool securely erases disks by performing a certificate-based validation of
the wipe process. It ensures that the data on the disk is completely and 
irrecoverably erased, protecting sensitive information from being recovered. 
The tool uses industry-standard wiping methods to securely erase the data on 
the disk, making it impossible to recover. The tool also generates a 
certificate of sanitize process that can be used to verify the authenticity of the wipe
process. This tool is perfect for businesses and individuals who need to
securely and permanently remove sensitive data from their disks.

## Dependencies
