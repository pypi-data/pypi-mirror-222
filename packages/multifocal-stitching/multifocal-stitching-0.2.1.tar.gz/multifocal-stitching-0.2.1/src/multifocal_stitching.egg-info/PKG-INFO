Multifocal Image Stitching
---------------
| **Documentation** | **Build Status** |
|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| [![][docs-latest-img]][docs-latest-url] | [![Build Status][build-img]][build-url] |

This package aims to:
- Accurately compute translation parameters between two images taken with a
  translation and focus change
- Be tolerant of high levels of noise and blurriness caused by the focus change

This package does not:
- Account for other non-translational camera models
- Calculate subpixel-level stitching coordinates
- Perform focus stacking or blending of images in any manner

### Examples

Matching using low-frequency features:

<img src="assets/image1.png" width="90%"/>

Matching using high-frequency features:

<img src="assets/image2.png" width="90%"/>

### Installation

To install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/multifocal-stitching/):

```
pip install multifocal-stitching
```

### Usage
Ensure the images to be stitched are sequentially named in `<dir>`, then run:

```
python -m multifocal_stitching <dir>
```

Most images can be stitched successfully with the default settings. To fine-tune
settings with the CLI:

```
python -m multifocal_stitching -h
