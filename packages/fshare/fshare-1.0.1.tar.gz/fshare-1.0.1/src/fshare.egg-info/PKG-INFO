# File-Share

File-Share is a Python 3 package that simplifies file sharing over a local network. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users to share files with other devices connected to the same network. Whether you want to transfer documents, images, videos, or any other files, File-Share has got you covered!

## Installation

To use File-Share, you need to have Flask installed. If you don't have Flask, you can install it using pip:

    pip install flask

Next, you can install File-Share using pip as well:

    pip install fshare

## Usage

Using File-Share is straightforward. Once you have installed the package and its dependencies, you can start sharing files with just a few lines of code. Here's an example of how to use File-Share in your Python script:


    from fshare import FileShare

    # Initialize the FileShare object
    file_share = FileShare()

    # Set the path to the directory containing files to be shared
    file_share.set_directory("/path/to/shared/files")

    # Start the file sharing server
    file_share.start_server()

    # Once the server is running, you can access it from other devices on the local network
    # Open a web browser and navigate to: http://your_server_ip:5000

    # To stop the server (when you're done sharing files), use:
    # file_share.stop_server()

File-Share is intended for use within local networks and is not designed for production environments or public internet access. As such, it does not provide advanced security features. Please ensure that you only use File-Share on trusted networks to avoid potential security risks.
