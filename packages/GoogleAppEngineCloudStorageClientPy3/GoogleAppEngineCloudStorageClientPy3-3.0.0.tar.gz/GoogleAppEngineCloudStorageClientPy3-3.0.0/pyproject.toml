description = """
This library is the preferred way of accessing Google
Cloud Storage from App Engine. It was designed to
replace the Files API. As a result it contains much
of the same functionality (streaming reads and writes but
not the complete set of GCS APIs). It also provides key
stability improvements and a better overall developer
experience.
