# Chik-Blockchain

**Chik** is a modern community-centric green cryptocurrency based on a proof-of-space-and-time consensus algorithm. It is a community-supported fork of the [Chik Network](https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain) codebase.

<h1>Windows Installer</h1>
<p>Download the Windows installer (exe) or Zip file - <a href="https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain/releases" rel="nofollow">Chik Blockchain Windows</a></p>
<p>As the Chik code signing certificate is new you will likely have to ask to keep the download and when you run the installer, you will have to choose "More Info" and "Run Anyway" to be able to run the installer. There is no need to use the command line. Some Windows anti-virus applications are seeing the download as a false positive. You can see the entire source code and build method here so we think it's safe for you to ask those tools to ignore it. Running the installer while plotting on a previous version will stop your plotting process, so be careful.</p>

<h1>Ubuntu/Debian Install</h1>
<p>
sudo apt-get update
 <p>
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
  </p>
  <p>
# Install Git
    <p>
sudo apt install git -y
  </p>
  <p>
# Checkout the source and install
    <p>
git clone https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain.git --recurse-submodules
<p>
      cd chik-blockchain
sh install.sh
<p>
. ./activate
chik init
    <p>
#add your plot directories the /.chik/main/config/config.yaml
      <p>
chik start famer<p>
#add your harvesters - https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain/wiki/Farming-on-many-machines
<p>
# The GUI requires you have Ubuntu Desktop or a similar windowing system installed.<p>
# You can not install and run the GUI as root
<p>
cd /home/'yourusername'/chik-blockchain/
  <p>
. ./activate
sh install-gui.sh
<p>
cd chik-blockchain-gui
npm run electron &
  </p>

 <h1>Ubuntu/Debian Update</h1>
<p>
  **Stop all chik processes (chik stop -d all) then,
<p>Delete ('rm -rf) your 'chik-blockchain' folder (**not your '.chik' folder**). Then clone 'chik-blockchain'.
  <p>
   git clone https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain.git --recurse-submodules
   <p>cd chik-blockchain
<p>sh install.sh
  <p> . ./activate
    <p> chik init
      <p> chik start farmer
  <p>
 *Note, if you would like to run the Timelord to support the Chik ecosystem, run 'sh install-timelord.sh', then chik start timelord. If you receive errors during the installation process, your system is missing dependencies. In this case, thank you for trying :)
