pyJellyfish : Python wrapper around Jellyfish (k-mer counter)
=============================================================

[![Python version][py-image]][py-link]
[![PyPi version][pypi-image]][pypi-link]

NOTE
----

This install script is not yet PEP517 compliant, which means the
wheel and setuptools packages *need* to be in your environment.

Do not forget this line when setting up your environment (see below):

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip
```

Introduction
------------

This tool essentially serves as an installer for Jellyfish for use with
Python. A small bundle of utilities is also included.

Install
-------

### With pip

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
python -m venv $HOME/.virtualenvs/km
source $HOME/.virtualenvs/km/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip
pip install .
```

### Options

Additionally, pyJellyfish contains an option to manually specify which
Jellyfish version one wishes to build against. This can be done by
running setup.py with the custom build command `jellyfish`.

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
source $HOME/.virtualenvs/km/bin/activate
python setup.py jellyfish --version 2.2.10
```

Note that the setup script will automatically detect if jellyfish has
already been built and use that instead of re-running the jellyfish step.
After running the previous command, installation will proceed as usual.

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
pip install .
```

#### Requirements

-   Python 3.6.0 or later
