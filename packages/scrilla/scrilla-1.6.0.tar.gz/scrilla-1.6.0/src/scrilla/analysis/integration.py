# Condition: E(integral of vol ^2 dt) < inf


def verify_volatility_condition(volatility_function: Callable) -> bool:
    r"""
    Ito calculus requires the class of volatility functions that scale a simple Weiner process (i.e., a process with independent, identically distributed increments with mean 0 and variance 1) satisfies the following

    $$ \int_{0}^{\infty} {\sigma (t)}^2 \,dt < \infty $$

    In order words, since the mean of an Weiner process increment is 0 (and thus \\(Var(X) = E(X^2)\\), this inequality imposes a condition on the process described by scaling the Weiner process by the volatility function: it must have a probability distribution that actually exists. This function returns a `bool` that signals whether or not the given function satisifies this condition.

    Parameters
    ----------
    1. **volatility_function** : ``Callable``
        A function that describes the volatility of a process as a function of time measured. Must accept scalar input.

def ito_integral(mean_function: Callable, volatilty_function: Callable, upper_bound: float, iterations: int = 1000):
    r"""
    Approximates the expectation of an Ito integral from 0 to `upper_bound` for a Weiner process described by a mean and volatility that are functions of time, i.e.

    $$ E\{d X(t)\} = E \{ \int_{0}^{\infty} {\mu (t)} \, dt + \int_{0}^{\infty} {\sigma(t)} \, dW(t) \} $$

    Parameters
    ----------
    1. **mean_function** : ``Callable``
        A function that describes the mean of a process as a function of time. Must accept scalar input.
    2. **volatility_function** : ``Callable``
        A function that describes the volatility of a process as a function of time. Must accept scalar input.
    3. **upper_bound** : ``float``
        Upper limit for the integral.
    4. **iterations** : ``int``
        The number of iterations in the Reimann-Stieltjes sum.
