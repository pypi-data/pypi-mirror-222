#### Are transactions sent to the real network?
When debugging a transaction with `ethdbg` everything is emulated locally and nothing is sent on the actual blockchain.
The connection to the chain RPC node is only needed to pull different information related to the transaction under debugging.

On the other hand, when using `ethpwn`, the library connects to the target blockchain and it is able to perform
operations on it. While you can use Sepolia ETH to perform your tests, always be careful NOT to use important accounts
with actual valuable funds when using `ethpwn` as the configuration can store them in plaintext for example


#### Are you gonna support other EVM-based chain?
While `ethpwn` can support other EVM-based blockchains, currently we do not have the manpower to maintain other
chains. We will rely on the community to further expand `ethpwn` in this direction if this is desired.

#### Are you gonna support non-EVM-based chain?
`ethpwn` uses `py-evm` as its execution backend, hence, any non-EVM-based blockchain is currently out of scope.

#### How can I contribute?
See our TODO, we are happy to accept pull requests for those features! If you have anything else in mind just reach out
on our Github page, or on twitter [@degrigis](https://twitter.com/degrigis), [@honululu](https://twitter.com/dreselli).
