## System Architecture

The primary purpose of Med-PaLM is to bridge the gap between diverse data types in medicine. The architecture is designed to natively handle textual, imaging, and genomic data types.

At the core of the system is a large multimodal generative model which has a flexible structure allowing it to encode and interpret biomedical data. The model is trained on a curated dataset, the MultiMedBench, which includes 14 different tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling.

## Commercial Applications

Med-PaLM has a wide range of potential commercial applications, from improving diagnostic accuracy and speed to offering new insights into complex medical cases.

- **Clinical Diagnostics**: With its multimodal approach, Med-PaLM can provide high accuracy diagnostic solutions, integrating information from different sources such as medical imaging, patient history, and genetic data.

- **Healthcare Research**: Med-PaLM's ability to integrate and interpret diverse datasets makes it an invaluable tool in biomedical research, enabling researchers to find novel connections and insights.

- **Telemedicine**: By providing quick and reliable analysis of medical data, Med-PaLM can potentially play a crucial role in telemedicine, helping provide healthcare services remotely.
