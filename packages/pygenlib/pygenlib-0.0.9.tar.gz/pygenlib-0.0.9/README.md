# PyGenLib

A Python library for generating other Python libraries.

## Installation

You can install `pygenlib` using `pip`:

```
pip install pygenlib
```

## Usage

To create a new Python library template, use the `pygenlib` command-line tool.

```
pygenlib my_custom_library
```

This will create a new library named `my_custom_library` in the current directory.

If you want to create the library in a specific folder, you can use the `--target` or `-t` option:

```
pygenlib my_custom_library --target /path/to/target_folder
```

This will create the library in the specified target folder.

After creating the template, you can customize the generated files to build your Python library as per your specific requirements.
