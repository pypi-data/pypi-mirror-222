## Description

Pytch is a small and efficient fetch script written in Python with no dependencies. It has a relatively fast execution time of ~20ms and is tested on Python versions 3.7 or newer and PyPy (it will probably work on earlier versions but has not been tested as such). It is configured by editing its source code, though the Python used is relatively simple and readable. Rest assured, if you do not understand something, open up an issue and I will be happy to explain it to you. Pytch currently supports macOS, FreeBSD, and many popular Linux distributions (see [`art.py`](https://github.com/kritdass/pytch/blob/main/src/pytch/art.py) for a list though most are not tested). If support is lacking for your system, please open up an issue and I will add support for your system.

## Installation

```
  $ pip install pytch-fetch
```
You will need a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to see the icons. I use [JetFlow](https://github.com/kritdass/JetFlow).
