# ebdp-lightweight

Lightweight modelling workflow for EBDP TWIN2EXPAND project

## Development

Project configuration is managed using a `pyproject.toml` file. [`pdm`](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) is suggested for installation and management of the packages and related upgrades. For example: `pdm install` will install packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file and creates a self-contained development environment in a `.venv` folder.
