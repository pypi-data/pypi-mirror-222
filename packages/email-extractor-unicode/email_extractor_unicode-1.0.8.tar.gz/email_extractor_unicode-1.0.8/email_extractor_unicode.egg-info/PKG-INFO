<h1>Email Extractor Unicode</h1>
<p>Email Extractor Unicode is a Python library that allows you to extract emails from web pages related to phone
   numbers. It utilizes the undetected_chromedriver library to browse web pages and extract emails using regular
   expressions.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install Email Extractor Unicode, you can use pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install email-extractor-unicode</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use the library, you can import the <code>extract_emails_from_phone_file</code> function from the package and
   call it with the path to the phone numbers file and the path where you want to save the extracted emails.
</p>
<pre><code>from email_extractor_unicode import extract_emails_from_phone_file

phone_file_path = 'path/to/phone.txt'
emails_file_path = 'path/to/emails.txt'

extract_emails_from_phone_file(phone_file_path, emails_file_path)</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>'path/to/phone.txt'</code> with the file path containing phone numbers, and
   <code>'path/to/emails.txt'</code> with the desired file path to save the extracted emails.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
