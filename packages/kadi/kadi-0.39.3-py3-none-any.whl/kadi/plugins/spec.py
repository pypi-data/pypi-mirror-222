def kadi_get_blueprints():
    """Hook for collecting custom Flask blueprints.

    Each plugin can return a single blueprint or a list of blueprints, which will be
    registered in the application. The definition of a custom blueprint may look like
    the following:

    .. code-block:: python3

        from flask import Blueprint

        bp = Blueprint(
            "my_plugin",
            __name__,
            url_prefix="/my_plugin",
            template_folder="templates",
            static_folder="static",
        )

    Next to the unique name of the blueprint, which should preferably correspond to the
    plugin name, the optional parameters of this blueprint specify a custom URL prefix,
    a folder for HTML templates and a folder for static files, respectively. The
    template and static folders should be relative to the blueprint's root path, while
    static files will be accessible using the path ``/my_plugin/static/<filename>`` in
    this example.

    Note that since API endpoints are handled a bit differently in the application, the
    existing API blueprint, which uses ``api`` as name and ``/api`` as URL prefix,
    should be preferred for custom API endpoints. An example on how to use it may look
    like the following:

    .. code-block:: python3

        from kadi.plugins import api_bp
        from kadi.plugins import json_response

        @api_bp.get("/my_plugin/<my_endpoint>")
        def my_endpoint():
            return json_response(200)
    """


@hookspec
def kadi_get_scripts():
    """Hook for collecting JavaScript sources.

    Each plugin can return a single string or a list of strings, each string
    representing the full URL where the script can be loaded from. As only internal
    scripts can currently be used, scripts should be loaded via a custom static route,
    which a plugin can define by using :func:`kadi_get_blueprints`.

    Note that by default, the scripts are inserted on every page. Plugins may limit each
    script to certain pages based on e.g. the current endpoint
    (``flask.request.endpoint``) or other requirements. In cases where no script should
    be inserted, the plugin has to return ``None``.

    An example of using this hook could be the registration of custom (global) Vue.js
    components, which can be used in combination with a template such as the one shown
    in :func:`kadi_get_preview_templates`:

    .. code-block:: js

        Vue.component('my-previewer-component', {
            // The data to preview. Its type depends on how the preview data is returned
            // from the backend.
            props: {
                data: String,
            },
            // Note the custom delimiters, which are used so they can coexist with
            // Jinja's templating syntax when not using single file components like in
            // this case.
            template: `
                <div>{$ data $}</div>
            `,
        })

    representing the capabilities. If the requirements for none of the capabilities are
    met, ``None`` can be returned instead.

    needs to contain all configuration and message catalog files required by the
    ``Babel``/``Flask-Babel`` Python libraries. The Kadi CLI contains some utility
    commands to help with creating and managing these files:

    .. code-block:: bash

        kadi i18n --help

    Note that translations of the main application always take precedence.

    For adding custom frontend translations, please see
    :func:`kadi_get_translations_bundles`.
    """


@hookspec
def kadi_get_translations_bundles(locale):
    """Hook for collecting translations bundles used for frontend translations.

    Each plugin has to return a single translations bundle consisting of a dictionary
    that maps the strings to translate to their corresponding translated values
    according to the given locale. This dictionary may also be constructed by loading an
    external JSON file, containing the actual translations.

    If a certain locale should be ignored, ``None`` can be returned instead. The same
    can be done to limit the translations to certain pages based on e.g. the current
    endpoint (``request.endpoint``) or other requirements.

    The translations can then be used in the frontend by calling the globally available
    ``$t`` function with the corresponding text to translate:

    .. code-block:: js

        const translatedText = $t('My translated text');

    This can be combined with custom scripts registered via
    :func:`kadi_get_scripts`, including the use in custom Vue.js components.

    Note that the texts to translate will themselves be used as a fallback if no
    corresponding translation can be found. Therefore, it is recommended to keep these
    texts in english, like in the example above, as english is used as the default
    locale in the application and will therefore need no further handling. Also note
    that translations of the main application always take precedence.

    For adding custom backend translations, please see
    :func:`kadi_get_translations_paths`.

    :param locale: The locale for which translations are collected, currently one of
        ``"en"`` or ``"de"``.

    All licenses have to be returned as a dictionary, mapping the unique name of a
    license to another dictionary, containing the title of the license and an optional
    URL further describing it.

    Before any custom licenses can be used, they have to be added to the database. This
    can be done using the Kadi CLI, which also allows updating and/or deleting licenses
    that have been added previously:
