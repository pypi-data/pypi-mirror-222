
This code takes the fastq_pass folder generated by the MinION and creates a new folder where the fastq files are sorted into bins based on the estimated size.  

Start with the fastq_pass folder with the barcode folders containing the zipped fastq files.  In the same parent directory, a new folder called 'fastq_bins' will be created.  The fastqs will be unzipped, read lengths are estimated, and then sorted into a folder called bin2000, bin5000, etc., where the bin number is the estimated plasmid size to enter in epi2me.  A summary file pdf is also added to the 'fastq_bins' directory.
