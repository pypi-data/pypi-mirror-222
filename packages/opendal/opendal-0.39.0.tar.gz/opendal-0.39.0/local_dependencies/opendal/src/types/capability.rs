/// Capability is used to describe what operations are supported
/// by current Operator.
///
/// Via capability, we can know:
///
/// - Whether current Operator supports read or not.
/// - Whether current Operator supports read with if match or not.
/// - What's current Operator max supports batch operations count.
///
/// Add fields of Capabilities with be public and can be accessed directly.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// Capabilities reflects the native support for operations. It's possible
/// that some operations are not supported by current Operator, but still
/// can be used.
///
/// For examples, we will support `seek` and `next` for all readers
/// returned by services.
///
/// # Naming Style
///
/// - Operation itself should be in lower case, like `read`, `write`.
/// - Operation with sub operations should be named like `presign_read`.
/// - Operation with variants should be named like `read_can_seek`.
/// - Operation with arguments should be named like `read_with_range`.
/// - Operation with limitations should be named like `batch_max_operations`.
