    API endpoint for Financial Contract analytics,
    that returns calculations relevant to each contract type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    direction : Direction or str, optional
        The direction of the leg.
    notional_ccy : str, optional
        The ISO code of the notional currency. Mandatory if instrument code or
        instrument style has not been defined. In case an instrument code/style has been
        defined, value may comes from the reference data.
    notional_amount : float, optional
        The notional amount of the leg at the period start date. Optional. By default
        1,000,000 is used.
    fixed_rate_percent : float, optional
        The fixed coupon rate in percentage. It is mandatory in case of a single leg
        instrument. Otherwise, in case of multi leg instrument, it can be computed as
        the Par rate.
    interest_payment_frequency : Frequency or str, optional
        The frequency of the interest payments. Optional if an instrument code/style
        have been defined : in that case, value comes from reference data. Otherwise, it
        is mandatory.
    interest_calculation_method : DayCountBasis or str, optional
        The Day Count Basis method used to calculate the coupon interest payments.
        Mandatory.
    accrued_calculation_method : DayCountBasis or str, optional
        The Day Count Basis method used to calculate the accrued interest payments.
        Optional. By default, the same value than interest_calculation_method is used.
    payment_business_day_convention : BusinessDayConvention or str, optional
        The method to adjust dates to a working day. Optional.
        In case an instrument code/style has been defined, value comes from
        bond reference data. Otherwise 'ModifiedFollowing' is used.
    first_regular_payment_date : str or date or datetime or timedelta, optional
        The first regular coupon payment date for leg with an odd first coupon.
        Optional.
    last_regular_payment_date : str or date or datetime or timedelta, optional
        The last regular coupon payment date for leg with an odd last coupon. Optional.
    payment_business_days : str, optional
        A list of coma-separated calendar codes to adjust dates (e.g. 'EMU' or 'USA').
        Optional. By default the calendar associated to notional_ccy is used.
    stub_rule : StubRule or str, optional
        The rule that defines whether coupon roll dates are aligned on the  maturity or
        the issue date. Optional. By default 'Maturity' is used.
    accrued_paid_on_default : bool, optional
        Specifies whether the accrued is paid at the credit event date or not.
        - true :  the accrued is paid at the credit event date
        - false :  the accrued is not paid at the credit event date Optional. Defaults
          to false.
    interest_payment_ccy : str, optional
        The ISO code of the interest payment currency. Mandatory.
