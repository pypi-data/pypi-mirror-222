Introduction
=============

`py_auth_micro` is a small identity provider library which can use an LDAP/AD as upstream Identity Provider and can also store Users Localy.

The Authentication and Authorization is done via `ID-Tokens` and `Access-Tokens`. The `ID-Tokens` are given out after a User successfully logged in.
With this `ID-Token` a User can request an `Access-Token` which he can send to other (Micro-)Services to gain access According to his Permissions.

The Tokens are `JWT` Tokens which can either be signed with an symetric `HMAC`-Secret or with an `RSA`-Key.
