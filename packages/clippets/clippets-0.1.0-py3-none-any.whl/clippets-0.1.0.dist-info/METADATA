This is a *beta* software. I believe that it is useful and usable in its current
form:

- It performs its basic function and provides a user interface that is good
  enough to support productive use.
- It has a fairly comprehensive test suite.
- I hope that crashes should be rare (backup files are maintained to minimise
  the impact).

However:

- It still needs more tests.
- There are areas of mouse and keyboard support that beg imrpovement.
- Some desirable features are obviously missing, such as:

  - There is no proper documentation beyound the built-in help.
  - It does not yet work on MacOS.
  - It should monitor the input file for changes.
