Open edX Filters from Hooks Extensions Framework (`OEP-50`_).

.. _OEP-50: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oep-0050-hooks-extension-framework.html

Purpose
*******

This repository implements the necessary tooling and
definitions used by the Hooks Extension Framework to
manage the filters execution and extra tools.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/openedx-filters.git
  cd openedx-filters

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 openedx-filters

Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  workon openedx-filters

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim …

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit …
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Deploying
=========

The Open edX Filters component is a Python library which doesn't
need independent deployment. Therefore, its setup is reasonably
straightforward. First, it needs to be added to your service
requirements, and then it will be installed alongside requirements
of the service.

If the service you intend to use is either the LMS or CMS, then
the library is installed alongside their requirements since the
Nutmeg release.
