influence-model
========

`influence_model` is a Python implementation of the influence model, a generative model that describes the interactions between networked Markov chains.

**Why influence_model?** It provides an efficient and well-documented implementation of Asavathiratham's influence model, and supports defining new influence models as well as generating observations through applying the model's evolution equations.

Install _influence-model_ by: 

```
pip install influence-model
```
