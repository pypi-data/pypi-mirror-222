# Declaration of the types and functions making up the dictionary module.
# A dictionary is meant to translate keys to values, both of them being
# integers.
# For example, a certain configuration register content could be
# translated into its physical data domain by means of a dictionary. The BMA456
# acceleration sensor can adjust its measurement range to +/- 2g, 4g, 8g or
# even 16g by setting its ACC_RANGE register to either 0, 1, 2 or 3,
# respectively. Considering the register content to be the key domain, whereas
# the corresponding range limits are the values, a dictionary would translate
# as follows:
# <table>
# <caption>Mapping between register content and range limits.</caption>
# <tr><th>key</th><th>value</th></tr>
# <tr><td>0</td><td>2000</td></tr>
# <tr><td>1</td><td>4000</td></tr>
# <tr><td>2</td><td>8000</td></tr>
# <tr><td>3</td><td>16000</td></tr>
# </table>
# It is also possible to translate vice-versa, i.e. from the value-domain into
# keys bэ finding the nearest matching key. The behavior of this search
# algorithm can be controlled by the dictionary's <em>mode</em> attribute.
# </p>
# <p>
# Note that at the advantage of runtime speed, this implementation assumes the
# dictionary be sorted by values in ascending order.
