LightweightDebugMessages
========================
The *LightweightDebugMessages* class is a lightweight class that adds a
simple console printing for debugging messages that can be enabled or
disabled via a parameter to classes by inheriting `LightweightDebugMessages`
as a superclass to a user class.

Documentation and User Guide
============================
See the [User Guide][3] for detailed documentation on the package.
This includes the API docs, user guide, and examples.

History
=======
*LightweightDebugMessages* is pulled from [*ConfigParserEnhanced*][3] into its
own module because it is an interesting and useful class. Splitting these up
was the intent from the beginning when it was originally developed.

Updates
=======
See [CHANGELOG][1] for information on changes.
