TODO

Can likely pull a lot of code from this tutorial:
https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial_motion.ipynb

It uses TensorFlow and relies on local TFRecord files.  Ideally, it would be framework
agnostic, and only accept the in-memory data needed for visualization.
