# UniPygame - A Unity-similar entity system for pygame
UniPygame is a system for unity-similar objects, but in pygame.
It allows you to define single entites and not have to bother with long complicated mainloops. 


## UniPygame Entities
A basic rect on the screen, would look like this:
```python
from UniPygame import Scene, Entity
import pygame



pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1080,720))
scene = Scene(surf = screen, clear_color = pygame.Color(255,255,255))

cube = Entity(scene = scene, color = pygame.Color(255, 0, 0), rect = pygame.Rect(100,100,100,100))

running = True
scene.Awake()
while running:
    if scene.quit_event:
        pygame.display.quit()
        running = False
    
    scene.Update(fps_limit = 60)
```

## UniPygame Sprites
As you might have seen in the example above, an ``Entity`` can only be a ``rect``.

If you, however want to add something like an image to a scene, you can use a different class, the ``Sprite``. It would look something like this:
```python
from UniPygame import Scene, Sprite, Vec2
import pygame



pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1080,720))
scene = Scene(surf = screen, clear_color = pygame.Color(255,255,255))

image = Sprite(scene = scene, image = pygame.image.load("image.png"), position = Vec2(100,100))

running = True
scene.Awake()
while running:
    if scene.quit_event:
        pygame.display.quit()
        running = False
    
    scene.Update(fps_limit = 60)
```
As you can see, not terribly different

And however large the amount of Entities and Sprites you add, the ```while running``` loop will always have the same size

## Frame functions
UniPygame's frame functions is UniPygames way of updating objetcs.
This example shows with Entities but it will also work for sprites, in the same way
The way they work is as follows:
```python
from UniPygame import Entity
import pygame



pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1080,720))
scene = Scene(surf = screen, clear_color = pygame.Color(255,255,255))

#First we define a frame function
#This function needs a parameter 'self' else it will spit out an error
def cube_move(self):
    #Here we move the object that inherites the function downwards
    #The speed of the object is multiplied by the delta time, so that it always moves by the same amount whatever the fps is
    self.position.y += 20 * scene.delta_time

#Then we define a object and set the frame_function to the cube_move function
cube = Entity(scene = scene, color = pygame.Color(255, 0, 0), rect = pygame.Rect(100,100,100,100), frame_function = cube_move)


running = True
scene.Awake()
while running:
    if scene.quit_event:
        pygame.display.quit()
        running = False
    
    #Now, when calling update, the cube_move function will be called
    scene.Update(fps_limit = 60)
```

## UniPygame Input system
Well, now you might be wondering, since the loop is always the same size, how will inputs work?
Well for that there is a parameter in the Scene class ``Scene.keydown_listener``, this parameter needs a function into it, this function has to have a keyword argument ``key``, everytime a button is pressed, this argument will be set to the pygame key code of the pressed key, and the function will be called.

An effective listener would look like this:
```python
from UniPygame import Scene
import pygame



pygame.init()
def keydown(key):
    if key == pygame.K_1:
        print("Key 1 has been pressed")
    if key == pygame.K_2:
        print("Key 2 has been pressed")
    if key == pygame.K_3:
        print("Key 3 has been pressed")

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1080, 720))
scene = Scene(surf = screen, clear_color = pygame.Color(255,255,255), keydown_listener = keydown)
```
Also, the same works for the keyup event, using the ``Scene.keyup_listener`` parameter.

But if you want continuus button presses, there is a list in the scene ``Scene.held_keys`` where you just have to index the pygame key code of the key you want to check if its pressed/held pressed, and do something with that.



There are some more functions, these however are documented in the wiki
