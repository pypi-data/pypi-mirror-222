    ReplicaWorker is a ray actor which inherits all the function
    of the Worker Class. As the name suggests, it is a replica
    worker and will be reproduced on all the node for parallel
    computations.

    We are using a replica worker class in place of directly using
    worker class, as Primary worker inherits Worker Class and A Ray
    Actor Class can't be inherited.
