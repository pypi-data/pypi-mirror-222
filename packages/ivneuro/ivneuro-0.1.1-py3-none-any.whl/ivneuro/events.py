    Make intervals based on timestamps

    Parameters
    ----------
    timestamps : np.ndarray or list
        Timestamps to use as reference to make intervals.
    start : int or float
        Start of interval, relative to timestamps.
    end : int or float
        End of interval, relative to timestamps.

    -------

def classify_events_base_on_time(event1,event2,treshold,mode='left'):
    """
    Clasiffy an event in two categories based on how close in time it occurs from an event of reference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event1 : numpy.array of shape (1 x n)
        Event to classify.
    event2 : numpy.array of shape (1 x m)
        Event of reference.
    treshold : TYPE
        Threshold amount of time used to classify events.
    mode : str, optional
        Define the mode of evaluation of proximity. "left", only looks event1 that occur before event2; "right", 
        only looks event1 that ocurr after event2; "both", look temporal proximity before and after. The default is 'left'.

    Returns
    -------
    near : np.array of shape (1 x o)
        Subset of event1 classified as temporally close to event2.
    far : np.array of shape (1 x p).
        Subset of event1 classified as temporally far from event2.
