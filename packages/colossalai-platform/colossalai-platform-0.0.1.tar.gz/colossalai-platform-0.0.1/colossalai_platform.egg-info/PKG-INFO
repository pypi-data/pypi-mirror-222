This repository contains the Command Line Tools for the ColossalAI Platform. 
The CLI is called `cap` which stands for `C(olossal)A(I) P(latform)`.
This CLI aims to provide an interface for users to access the various functions provided on the cloud platform and boost their productivity. 


The CLI is built on top of [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/), a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary.
