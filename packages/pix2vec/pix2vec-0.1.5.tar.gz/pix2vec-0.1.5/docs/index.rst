Welcome to pix2vec's documentation!
======================================

**pix2vec** is a command line program to process hyperspectral data 
cubes into vector GIS files.  

The vector representation of the cube ground pixels is saved into a 
geopackage file, thus, the data can be queried as you would with a database.
