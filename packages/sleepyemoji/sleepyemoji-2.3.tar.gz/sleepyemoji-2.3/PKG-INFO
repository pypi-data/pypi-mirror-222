# **SleepyEmoji**
*Fetch your favorite emojis fast!*

<br />

## **Welcome to sleepyemoji!**
There's now a paralyzing volume of unicode characters known as "emojis", which is great for creative expression, but bad for fetching the ~%10 of emojis you ever care to use.

SleepyEmoji has entered the chat!

## **Get Started 🚀**
<hr>

To Install:
```sh
pip install sleepyemoji
```
To update:
```sh
pip install sleepyemoji --upgrade
```

And set a personal alias in your shell to run the following script:
```python
from sleepyemoji import sleepyemoji
from sys import argv, exit

sleepyemoji(argv[1:])

exit(0)
```

That's it! It will handle command line argument passthrough. \
This document assumes the script alias to be `emoji`.

<br />

## **Usage ⚙**
<hr>

After setting up the tool, run `emoji [-h|--help]` to display this message:
```txt
This tool prints emojis of one or more catgories, each defined in their own file.

## **Technologies 🧰**

  - Just vanilla Python3 🙂

<br />

## **Contribute 🤝**
<hr>

This tool is kept in **Envi**, where emoji data is added in `emojis/toolchain` in the corresponding folders. This repository is private, thus the user must appreciate my favorite emojis, mwahahaha!

Remember to pull before you push!
