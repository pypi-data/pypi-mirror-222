# **SleepyEmoji**
*Fetch your favorite emojis fast!*

<br />

## **Welcome to sleepyemoji!**
There's now a paralyzing volume of unicode characters known as "emojis", which is great for creative expression, but bad for fetching the ~%10 of emojis you ever care to use.

SleepyEmoji has entered the chat!

## **Get Started üöÄ**
<hr>

To Install:
```sh
pip install sleepyemoji
```
To update:
```sh
pip install sleepyemoji --upgrade
```

And set a personal alias in your shell to run the following script:
```python
from sleepyemoji import sleepyemoji
from sys import argv, exit

sleepyemoji(argv[1:])

exit(0)
```

That's it! It will handle command line argument passthrough. \
This document assumes the script alias to be `emoji`.

<br />

## **Usage ‚öô**

After setting up the tool, run `emoji [-h|--help]` to display this message:
