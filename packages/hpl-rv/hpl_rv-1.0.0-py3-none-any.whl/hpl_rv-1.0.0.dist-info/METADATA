# HPL Runtime Verification

This project provides a tools from which you can build and manage runtime monitors based on [HPL properties](https://github.com/git-afsantos/hpl-specs/).

- [Tooling](#tooling)

## Installation

Install this package with

```
pip install hpl-rv
```

## Usage

This package provides a command line interface from which you can generate runtime monitors with a simple command.

```bash
# generating monitors from a specification file
hplrv gen -f my_spec.hpl
# generating monitors directly from properties
hplrv gen "globally: no /a"
# redirecting the output to a file
hplrv gen -o ./code.py "globally: some /b within 100ms"
```

When used as a library, you can generate Python code for a runtime monitor class with a few simple steps.
For example:

```python
from hplrv.gen import lib_from_properties
hpl_properties = ['globally: no (/a or /b)']
code: str = lib_from_properties(hpl_properties)
print(code)
```

## GitHub Features

The `.github` directory comes with a number of files to configure certain GitHub features.

- Various Issue templates can be found under `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
- A Pull Request template can be found at `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Automatically mark issues as stale after a period of inactivity. The configuration file can be found at `.stale.yml`.
- Keep package dependencies up to date with Dependabot. The configuration file can be found at `dependabot.yml`.
- Keep Release Drafts automatically up to date with Pull Requests, using the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). The configuration file can be found at `release-drafter.yml` and the workflow at `workflows/release-drafter.yml`.
- Automatic package building and publishing when pushing a new version tag to `main`. The workflow can be found at `workflows/publish-package.yml`.

## Tooling

This package sets up various `tox` environments for static checks, testing, building and publishing.
It is also configured with `pre-commit` hooks to perform static checks and automatic formatting.

If you do not use `tox`, you can build the package with `build` and install a development version with `pip`.

Assume `cd` into the repository's root.

To install the `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run type checking:

```bash
tox -e typecheck
```

To run linting tools:

```bash
tox -e lint
```

To run automatic formatting:

```bash
tox -e format
```

To run tests:

```bash
tox
```

To build the package:

```bash
tox -e build
```

To build the package (with `build`):

```bash
python -m build
```

To clean the previous build files:

```bash
tox -e clean
```

To test package publication (publish to *Test PyPI*):

```bash
tox -e publish
```

To publish the package to PyPI:

```bash
tox -e publish -- --repository pypi
```

To install an editable version:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
