"""
Module that summarizes an assignment group by conjunctive average.

Conjunctive average means: 

  1) We need all assignments to have a non-F grade.
  2) If there are A--F assignments present, we will compute the average of 
     those grades. For instance; an A and a C will result in a B; an A and a B 
     will result in an A, but an A with two Bs will become a B (standard 
     rounding).
