.. start_doc

Hypixel.py is a modern, asynchronous, feature-rich, Hypixel API wrapper for Python.

The purpose of this project is to simplify the task of writing scripts that interact with the Hypixel API by converting responses into organized python models and abstracting requests into asynchronous functions, while also offering customization options and useful features.

* **Blazing fast (for python)** --- Prioritizes speed and efficiency by using built in libraries to achieve asynchronous timed caching, quick nested dataclass sterilization, and modern rate limit handling.
* **More asynchronous than online learning** --- Has full asynchronicity and uses modern pythonic ``async`` and ``await`` syntax.
* **Cleaner than your room** --- Uses object oriented pythonic dot syntax for all of its models, so you can easily access any data point without worrying about dictionaries, strings, and any random inconsistencies you may encounter using the raw API.
* **S Tier Docs** --- Highly maintained documentation with an ample amount of examples to get you started. It also has the highest player model and coverage documentation.

.. end_doc


Getting Started
---------------

**Check out the** `examples <https://docs.dubs.rip/en/latest/examples.html>`_ **and** `documentation <https://docs.dubs.rip/en/latest/>`_!

**Python 3.8+ is required (3.10.8+ recommended)**

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install hypixel.py, install it from pypi under the name
``hypixel.py`` with pip or your favorite package manager.

.. code:: sh

   pip install hypixel.py --upgrade

You can append ``[speed]`` to install optional packages (see below) to
improve the performance of aiohttp and json.
**Warning:** cchardet does not support python 3.10+ and subsequently
will not be installed using [speed] if you're on 3.10 or higher.

.. code:: sh

   pip install hypixel.py[speed] --upgrade

Optional Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ehnahce aiohttp performance:

- `aiodns <https://pypi.org/project/aiodns/>`_
- `brotlipy <https://pypi.org/project/brotlipy/>`_
- `cchardet <https://pypi.org/project/cchardet/>`_

To enhance json decoding (up to 4x faster):

- `ujson <https://pypi.org/project/ujson/>`_

Warning
^^^^^^^

If you are running a Python version older than 3.10.8 on Windows, you
must run the following code before calling asyncio.run:

.. code:: python

   # This is because of a bug in the Windows Proactor Event Loop Policy
   # which is the default on Windows.
   asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())

Quick Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

   import hypixel
   from hypixel import HypixelException
   import asyncio

   async def main():
       client = hypixel.Client('api-key')
       async with client:
           try:
               player = await client.player('gamerboy80')
               print(f'[{player.bedwars.level}âœ«] [{player.rank}] {player.name}')
           except HypixelException as error:
               print(error)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       asyncio.run(main())

**You can find more examples** `in the documentation <https://docs.dubs.rip/en/latest/examples.html>`_
